### Is there a document for 2-player conventions?

https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md

<br />

### What is the reason to play 1’s in the starting hand from right-to-left (instead of from left-to-right)?

https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Reasons.md#play-order-of-multiple-1s

<br />

### I found a bug on the website. What should I do?

- First, look to see if someone has already posted an issue about the bug: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/issues
- If there is not an existing issue, then make one: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/issues/new
  - (You will need to create a free GitHub account.)

<br />

### Why isn't [situation X] defined in the conventions document?

Not everything has to have a meaning. We intentionally want to have situations be undefined so that we have some wiggle room to handle a wide variety of game states: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Goals.md

### [Situation X] is undefined in the conventions document. I want to propose a new convention to define what it will mean.

Sorry, but probably not.

<br />

### In what order should 1’s be played?

Chop, fresh 1’s left to right, opening 1’s right to left.

<br />

### Am I allowed to perform a *2 Save* or a *5 Save* on someone who has a play?

Yes.

<br />

### Can a 2 be saved with a color clue if the other copy is in the trash?

Yes.

<br />

### What is the precedence of the different "5 moves"?

*5 Save* > 5 *Stall* > *5 Chop Move* > *5 Pull*

<br />

### Is a number 5 clue always a *5 Save* on the chop card, if there are play clues available?

Yes.

<br />

### Does it matter who gives a *Save Clue*?

No. Unless it is super, super bad for one person to be giving it, then it would be a *Finesse* or something.

<br />

### Why do *5 Stalls* exist?

It means that random 3's and 4's on people's chop survive longer.

<br />

### Are all *Finesses* by a *5-Pulled* player *Certain Finesses*?

Yes.

<br />

### If a *5 Pull* touches slot 1 and slot 3 in 3-player game, does this call for a blind play on slot 2 or slot 4?

Slot 2.

<br />

### Is known trash considered to be the chop card?

No. Even if you have a known safe discard, your chop is still the right-most unclued card.

<br />

### If my chop is *Finessed*, does it still count as chop?

No.

<br />

### Does discarding known trash end the *Early Game*?

No, only discarding an unknown card from chop does.

<br />

### Does misplaying end the *Early Game*?

No, only discarding an unknown card from chop does.

<br />

### If I have a clued card in my hand that is *Chop Moved* in someone else's hand, should I perform a *Sarcastic Discard*?

No, they will misplay their *Finesse Position* as a *Gentleman's Discard*. This forces someone else on the team to waste a clue as a *Fix*.

<br />

### When should a *Fix Clue* be done?

Anytime. Doesn't necessarily have to be early, doesn't necessarily have to be done "just in time".

<br />

### Who should give a *Fix Clue* when a player performs a *Finesse with a Lie Component*?

- Almost always, the player who initiated the move.
- Alternatively, someone else on the time can also give a *Fix Clue* if they are "in" on the lie, meaning that they see both copies of the card, etc.

<br />

### If I am *Finessed*, and I get a *Fix Clue* to stop me from bombing my *Finesse Position*, and the *Fix Clue* touches my chop and some other card, which one should I play into the *Finesse*?

You should not play the chop. You should play the card that is closest to your *Finesse Position*.

### I receive a clue that touches several cards and focuses on chop. Later I am *Prompted*. Which card should I play?

Left-most.

<br />

### Should I always *Chop Move* after receiving a *Tempo Clue*?

No! There are FIVE conditions where *Tempo Clues* are allowed. If any of these five conditions are true, then you should not *Chop Move*: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-tempo-clue-re-cluing-a-card-to-play

<br />

### Does *[Schrodinger's Cat Principle](../Reference#schrödingers-cat-principle)* always take priority over *[Occam's Razor](../Reference.md#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)*?

Yes.

<br />

### What does "one-away-from-playable" mean?

- For example, a red 4 is one-away-from-playable if the red 2 is played.
- For example, a red 4 is one-away-from-playable if the red 1 is played and the red 3 is already clued in someone's hand.

<br />

### A card has a positive number 3 clue on it. It is clued again with red, which fills in the card. A red 1 blind-plays. Is it a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*?

- It does not matter if the card is "brand new" or if it has a clue on it already.
- All that matters is if the clue matches the blind-play.
- Here, a red 1 matches a red color clue, so it is a *Finesse*.

<br />

### A card has a positive red clue on it. It is clued again with number 3, which fills in the card. A red 1 blind-plays. Is it a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*?

- It does not matter if the card is "brand new" or if it has a clue on it already.
- All that matters is if the clue matches the blind-play.
- Here, a red 1 does not match a number 3 clue, so it is a *3 Bluff*.

<br />

### Can I perform a *Certain Finesse* from *Bluff Seat*?

No.

<br />

### Should I play all known-playable clued cards before blind-playing *Finesse Position* in case it is a *Layered Finesse*?

No. You must blind-play immediately.

<br />

### If I have *Elimination Notes*, and receive a clue that identifies the exact position of this card, and other cards are touched, are the other cards promised to be playable?

No. The clue is only focused on the card with the *Elimination Notes*.

<br />

### Can you do an *Elimination Finesse* on the second card of a *Double Finesse*?

Yes. Any type of *Finesse* can be an *Elimination Finesse*.

<br />

### What takes precedence: a *Finesse* through a touched card, or a *Hard Bluff*?

*Hard Bluff*.

<br />

### What takes precedence: a *Finesse with a Lie Component* or a *Patch Finesse*?

Everything takes precedence over a *Patch Finesse*.

<br />

### Can I delay playing into a *Finesse* to perform a *Gentleman's Discard*?

No. You are only allowed to delay playing into a *Finesse* if you are performing a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*.

<br />

### Why does *Gentleman’s Discard* only get the matching card instead of all of the various possibilities?

Because there is a lot of asynchronous information.

<br />

### Can I discard a *Finessed* card as a *Gentleman's Discard*?

No. It could also be a *Layered Finesse* on you. The only time you are ever allowed to blind-discard *Finesse Position* is in response to a *Certain Finesse*.

<br />

### Can I discard a *Finessed* card if the *Finesse* is ambiguous and I want to pass it back?

No. It could also be a *Layered Finesse* on you. The only time you are ever allowed to blind-discard *Finesse Position* is in response to a *Certain Finesse*.

<br />

### Can I pass back an *Ambiguous Finesse* that was passed back to me?

No.

<br />

### Can blind-playing a card from a *Gentleman's Discard* trigger *Priority*?

Yes. Playing a card from a *Gentleman's Discard* does not count as blind-playing a card.

<br />

### Which has *Priority*: red 3 or blue 5 while the team is at 8 clues?

Red 3, so the extra clue from the 5 is not wasted.

<br />

### Which has *Priority*: red 3 or green 4 if both red 4's have been discarded?

Green 4. The red 3 does not count as being a "lower rank" card in this case. It is equivalent in rank to a 5.

<br />

### Should I play my *Finesse Position* into a *Priority Finesse* if I see the matching card in someone else's hand?

- No. A *Load Clue* takes precedence over a *Priority Finesse* or a *Priority Bluff*.
- The only exception is if the card is uncluable (e.g. blocked on both sides).

<br />

### Can I *Bluff* a clued card?

No. Playing a clued card does not "prove" anything because the player might have found out that the card was playable through some other read.

<br />

### Can I perform a *Reverse Double Bluff*?

Only if both blind-plays would happen immediately. (e.g. Alice clues Bob, Bob blind-plays, Cathy blind-plays.)

<br />

### Can I perform a *Reverse Patch Finesse*?

No.

<br />

### Can I perform a *Priority Bluff* that gets a blind-play of a card that is clued in my hand or clued in someone else's hand?

No. That is defined as a *Layered Priority Finesse*.

<br />

### Can I perform a *Layered Baton Discard*?

No. After a *Baton Discard* happens, any follow-up *Finesses* will skip over the slot promised from the *Baton Discard*.

<br />

### If a clue is clearly a *Bad Touch*, does it promise the missing card on *Finesse Position*?

No. It only promises that the matching cards are in your hand. Write *Trash Touch Elimination Notes*.

<br />

### What is the reason behind discarding trash from left to right?

- Examine the following replay: https://hanabi.live/replay/16627/32
- From xdragun's perspective, Zamiel's clue can be either a *Trash Finesse* or a *Play Clue* on the purple 1.
- If it is a *Trash Finesse*, xdragun can discard slot 1, proving this to everyone.
- If it is a *Play Clue* on the purple 1, xdragun can perform a *Gentleman's Discard* without communicating a *Trash Order Chop Move* on Zamiel.
- If the conventions were in the opposite order, then xdragun would be in a very shitty situation.

<br />

### Are *Loaded Play Clues* turned on for brown cards, even if it is the *Early Game* and there is nothing else to do?

Yes.

<br />

### Does *Good Touch Principle* apply to pink cards?

Yes.

<br />

### If I am *Prompted* for a card, but I got a *Save Clue* earlier for that color/rank, what do I do?

- If you get a *Save Clue* on a chop card and you can narrow down the possibilities to one exact card, then:
  - You should write a note on the card for that exact possibility.
  - If the card is *Prompted* later, then you can skip over other cards in your hand and play that exact card.
- If you get a *Save Clue* on a chop card and there are two or more possibilities, then:
  - You should write a note on the card for all of the possibilities. The card is now in a *superposition*.
  - If you are *Prompted* later on for a card that matches one of the possibilities, then:
    - If all of the possibilities in the *superposition* are now playable, then you should play the card from the original *Save Clue* first. If that was not the card, then you can continue playing cards left-to-right.
    - If not all of the possibilities in the *superposition* are playable, then you should simply play cards from left-to-right. (The *Prompt* does not collapse the *superposition* if it could apply to other cards.)

<br />

### In variants with a pink suit, if I have cards in my hand that only have a rank clue on them, which ones am I allowed to play?

- You can only play cards with a number 1 clue on them.
  - If a card with a number 1 clue on it happens to be some other unplayable pink card, then someone else on the team is required to give a *Pink Fix Clue*.
- You are not allowed to play cards with a number 2 clue on them, a number 3 clue on them, etc. (Because they could be a pink 5.)
  - No-one else on the team is expected to give a *Pink Fix Clue* in this case.)

<br />

### In variants with a pink suit, If 1's were clued in my hand, and all of the 1's are already played, should I play my next number 1 card as a pink 2?

No. You should hold on to it for later. It could be any other useful pink card.

<br />

### What takes precedence for null cards: *Play Clues* or *Null Finesses*?

*Null Finesses*. (Otherwise, it would be impossible to perform a *Reverse Null Finesse*.)
