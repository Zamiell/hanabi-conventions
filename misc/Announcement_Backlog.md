## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone New conventions:

**The Shadow Finesse**

**The Shadow Finesse** (by pianoblook)

```
* When playing with expert players, it is rare for them to "miss" the chance to *Finesse* a card.
* If an expert player could cleanly *Finesse* a card but instead opts to clue it directly, there must be a good reason.
* If the clue does **not** touch any other new cards, and it is **not** an emergency situation, and it is **not** a mistake, then the player must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, the player giving the clue intends for the next player to blind-play from the *Finesse Position* that **matches the true *Finesse Position*** of the other card. This is called a *Shadow Finesse* because the positional blind-play is a "shadow" of the card that could have been used for the normal *Finesse*.
* The first card to blind-play is called the *shadow* and the second card to blind-play is called the *shadow target*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Donald has a red 2 on his slot 4. Alice could have instead clued red to Donald to *Finesse* Cathy's red 1.
  * Bob sees no other explanation for this, so he knows that this must be a *Shadow Finesse* - Bob must hold the red 2's "shadow".
  * Since the red 2 is in Donald's *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4), Bob immediately plays his *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy can see all of the other hands and understands Alice's clue. Cathy plays the clued red 1.
  * Donald is very surprised to see Bob play his *Forth Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  * Donald blind-plays the red 2 (the shadow target) from his slot 4.
* The *shadow* in a *Shadow Finesse* **must** exist in the immediate next player's hand, similar to a *Bluff*. And the player holding the *shadow* **must** blind-play it immediately to resynchronize the team, similar to a *Bluff*.
* Once a *shadow* has been blind-played, the team should consider the *shadow target* as being fully known and "touched". (In other words, it no longer occupies a *Finesse Position*.)
* Remember that *Shadow Finesses* work with *Finesse Positions*, **not** with slot numbers.
* A *Shadow Finesse* is **illegal** if the blind-play could be misinterpreted as some other kind of move. For example:
  * If the *shadow* is on the *First Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *Bluff* or a *Trash Finesse*.
  * If the *shadow* is on the *Second Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *5 Color Ejection*
  * If the *shadow* is on the *Third Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
* The *shadow* **must** come before the *shadow target*. In other words, it is **illegal** for Bob to hold the *shadow target*, since he cannot see that a *Shadow Finesse* is occurring (and therefore might try to get the *shadow*).
```

**The Reverse Shadow Finesse** (by pianoblook)

```
* *Shadow Finesses* can also be performed in reverse.
* *Reverse Shadow Finesses* are more complicated than normal *Shadow Finesses*, because the person with the clued card has to look ahead to determine whether or not **they** have the *shadow*, or if a **future** player has the *shadow*.
* For an example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that his red card must be a red 1.
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Alice could have instead clued red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Finesse*.
  * Bob recognizes that Alice must be a *Shadow Finesse*. Bob now must determine where the *shadow* lies.
  * Bob sees that Donald's red 2 is on his *Third Finesse Position*.
  * Bob looks at Cathy's *Third Finesse Position*. If it is playable, then Cathy holds the *shadow*. If it is not playable, then Bob holds the *shadow*.
  * Cathy has a blue 1 in her *Third Finesse Position*, so Bob knows that Cathy holds the *shadow*.
  * Bob plays his clued red 1.
  * Similar to Bob, Cathy also knows that this is a *Shadow Finesse*. Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position*. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Donald is very surprised to see Cathy blind-play her *Third Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  * Donald blind-plays the *shadow target* from his *Third Finesse Position*.
```

@everyone Variant-specific conventions:

**Throw It in a Hole** (change)

```
* Throw It in a Hole variants are now considered to be a hard, meaning that Loaded Play Clues are "turned on" and so forth.
```

<br />

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**Trash Finesses & Trash Bluffs in Pink**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* When a *Trash Finesse* or a *Trash Bluff* happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
* When a Trash Finesse* or a *Trash Bluff* happens in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the focused card was trash, and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
* In this situation, after discarding the focus of the *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*, the player should then hold on to the other touched cards.
```

**Pink Promise with a 5 Stall**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* When a player performs a *5 Stall*, it is clearly a type of *Save Clue*. But if two or more 5's are touched as part of the clue, the focus of the clue is unclear.
* We define the focus of the clue to be the specific 5 that is closest to the chop.
* Thus, when a player knows for sure that a number 5 clue indicates a *5 Stall*, *Pink Promise* only applies to the 5 that is closest to the chop.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * The variant is "Pink (6 Suits)".
  * It is the *Early Game* and all of the *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* have been extinguished.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching two 5's on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Bob knows that this is a *5 Stall*. Bob knows that the clue is either focused on slot 1 or slot 2.
  * Because of the "Pink Promise with a 5 Stall" convention, Bob knows that since this clue is focused on slot 2.
  * Thus, *Pink Promise* applies to this card, so he marks slot 2 as a 5.
  * Later on in the game, another rank clue "fills in" Bob's slot 2 card to be a pink card. From *Pink Promise*, Bob knows that it must be exactly the pink 5.
```

**Pink Promise with a 5 Pull**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* First, see [Pink Promise with a 5's Chop Move](#pink-promise-with-a-5s-chop-move).
* When a player performs a *5 Pull*, it is clearly a type of *Play Clue*. But if two or more 5's are touched as part of the clue, then the focus of the clue is unclear.
* We define the focus of the clue to be the next to the "pulled" card. (This is similar to how *Pink Promise* works with a *5's Chop Move*.)
* Thus, when a player knows for sure that a number 5 clue indicates a *5 Pull*, the *Pink Promise* convention only applies to the 5 that is next to the pulled card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * The variant is "Pink (6 Suits)".
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching two 5's on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Bob knows that this is a *5 Pull*, because he sees that Cathy has a bunch of playable cards in her hand that Alice could have clued instead.
  * Bob blind-plays his slot 3. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Next, Bob retroactively considers the implications of the *5 Pull*. Bob knows that the *5 Pull* was either focused on slot 1 or slot 2.
  * Because of the "Pink Promise with a 5 Pull" convention, Bob knows that since this clue was a *5 Pull*, it must be focused on slot 2 (the card that was next to the pulled card).
  * Thus, *Pink Promise* applies to this card, so he marks slot 2 as a 5.
  * Later on in the game, another rank clue "fills in" Bob's slot 2 card to be a pink card. From *Pink Promise*, Bob knows that it must be exactly the pink 5.
```

**The Bubblegum Bluff** (by Stephen)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* Similar to a *Bubblegum Finesse*, it is also possible to perform a *Bubblegum Bluff*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a pink 2 on slot 5.
  * Bob knows that Alice is violating *Pink Promise*. This must mean that he is supposed to play his slot 3 card.
  * Bob blind-plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  * Cathy knows that if this was a *3 Bluff*, then Bob would have played his *Finesse Position*. So it cannot be a *3 Bluff*.
  * Thus, Cathy knows that this must be a *Bubblegum* clue. Since blue 3 is not a pink card and Alice was in *Bluff Seat* for Bob, this must be a *Bubblegum Bluff*.
  * Cathy marks her slot 5 card as the one-away-from-playable pink card, the pink 2.
* *Bubblegum Bluffs* can only be performed on non-pink cards; otherwise, it will look like a *Double Finesse* with one part *Bubblegum Finesse* and one part normal *Finesse*.
* Note that it is impossible to *3 Bluff* and *Bubblegum Bluff* at the same time.
```

**Reverse Finesse Restriction** (by Florrat)

```
* This convention only applies in a Cow & Pig variant.
* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)
```

@everyone Variant-specific conventions:

**Dark Pink Tempo Clues** (by Kakashi)

```
* Normally, *Tempo Clues* on pink cards would never cause a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* (because *Tempo* on pink cards is important).
* However, this does not apply to dark pink cards. *Tempo Clues* on dark pink cards work as they normally do. (Meaning that it is possible to perform a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* by giving a *Tempo Clue* to a dark pink card, provided that all of the other normal *Tempo Clue Chop Move* conditions are met.)
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit .
* Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* does not apply in this variant.
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo-Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit.
* In situations where there are critical cards behind Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* the cards with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
```

**Null Color Positional Clue Skips** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* When determining the slot number of a *Null Positional Clue* that uses a color, you are now supposed to skip over any card with one or more positive clues on it. (But do not skip over the card if it is considered "untouched" from a *Positional Clue*.)
* For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  * Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, red 1, null 1, blue 1, blue 5`
  * Bob's blue 5 has a number 5 clue on it. (It was clued with a *5 Save* earlier on.)
  * Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a green 1.
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*. But all *Discharges* are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a *Null Positional Clue*.
  * Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, green would refer to slot 4, since there are 5 slots in the hand and green is the 2nd rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 5 card already has a clue on it, he should skip over that card. So this must be targeting his slot 3 (e.g. his 2nd rightmost unclued slot).
  * Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 3.
```

**Null Color Positional Clue Wraparound** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* *Color Positional Clues* always "wrap around" to the oldest card.
* For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  * Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `null 1, red 1, red 5, blue 5, green 5`
  * All of Bob's 5's have a number 5 clue on them. (They were clued with a *5 Save* earlier on.)
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1.
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*. But all *Discharges* are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a *Null Positional Clue*.
  * Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, red would refer to slot 2, since there are 5 slots in the hand and red is the 4th rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 card already have a clue on it, he should skip over those cards.
  * This means that blue would target slot 2 and green would target slot 1. Yellow would target slot 2 again (because of the wraparound) and red would target slot 1.
  * Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 1.
```

**Advanced Conventions for Variant with No Positive Clues**

```
* Various conventions for Duck have been deleted / reformulated.
* We now have a framework that is used for any variant with no positive clues (e.g. Extremely Ambiguous, Duck, etc.).
* For more information, please see: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/No_Positive_Clues.md
```

**The Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)** (for null)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* Sometimes, a player will have two critical cards in a row on chop. Usually, the team will work together to clue both of the cards. However, in variants with a null suit, it is sometimes difficult to do this.
* In cases where one player needs to save two cards at once, they can perform a *Scream Blind-Play* by blind-playing their chop card. This is similar to a *Scream Discard*, except it *Chop Moves* two cards instead of one.
* Just like the *Scream Discard*, the *Scream Blind-Play* is only to be used as a last resort. This should be obvious, since it uses up a strike.
```

**Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a muddy rainbow suit.
* In variants with a pink suit, the *Pink Choice Tempo Clue* convention is "turned on", since players often have a *Free Choice* with how they can clue pink cards. Muddy rainbow has a similar convention.
* When one or more muddy rainbow cards are retouched with a color clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what color is chosen. The color chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
* The slot number is calculated in roughly the same way that *Null Color Positional Clues* are calculated. In short, the slot number corresponds to the ordering of the colors **from right to left**. But skip the cards that are not touched by the color clue. Furthermore, colors always "wrap around" to the oldest card.
* For example, in a 3-player game of the "Muddy Rainbow (6 Suits)" variant:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has two muddy rainbow cards clued in his hand on slot 3 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches both muddy rainbow cards and nothing else.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Tempo Clue* on the muddy rainbow cards, so now he must figure out which slot Alice wants him to play. To start with, Bob knows that the colors available to clue in this variant are red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
  * Starting from the final color, a purple clue would mean to play slot 4, a blue clue would mean to play slot 3, a green clue would mean to play slot 4 (wraparound), a yellow clue would mean to play slot 3, and a red clue would mean to play slot 4 (another wraparound).
  * Bob plays his slot 4 card as a muddy rainbow 3. It successfully plays on the stacks.
* Similar to how *Tempo Clues* work with pink cards and brown card, *Tempo Clues* on muddy rainbow cards are never *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* or *Double Tempo Clues* - they only promise the one card and that's it.
* *Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues* are only allowed to get muddy rainbow cards.
  * An exception to this rule can be made for extremely difficult variants. If the team needs to get a non-muddy card for some specific purpose (e.g. to "unlock" another player), and there was not another good way to "get" the card, then it should be clear to everyone what is happening.
```

**Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues (Skipping Over Unplayable Cards)** (by Jeff)

```
* If known-unplayable cards are touched as part of a *Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue*, then they should be skipped over.
* For example, in a 3-player game of the "Muddy Rainbow (6 Suits)" variant:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has two muddy rainbow cards clued in his hand on slot 2 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card. He also has a red 5 on slot 3 with a 5 clue on it.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches both muddy rainbow cards and the red 5.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Tempo Clue* on the muddy rainbow cards, so now he must figure out which slot Alice wants him to play. To start with, Bob knows that the colors available to clue in this variant are red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
  * Starting from the final color, a purple clue would mean to play slot 4.
  * A blue clue would normally mean to play slot 3, but the red 5 is a known unplayable card, so Bob skips over that. Thus, a blue clue would mean to play slot 2.
  * A green clue would mean to play slot 4 (wraparound).
  * A yellow clue would mean to play slot 2 (skipping over the red 5 again).
  * A red clue would mean to play slot 4 (another wraparound).
  * Bob plays slot 4 as the muddy rainbow 3.
```

**The Slot Finesse** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if a *Positional Clue* is used to get a non-null card, then the blind-playing player would continue blind-playing cards as a *Positional Layered Finesse*. For that reason, it is normally impossible to *just* get a non-null card with a *Positional Clue*.
* As a rare exception, players can perform a *Finesse* using a *Positional Clue* that has the blind-play "match" the card that was clued. If they match, then **no null cards are promised**.
* This is called a *Slot Finesse* to distinguish it from a *Positional Finesse*. In other words, *Positional Finesses* use *Positional Clues* to get null cards to blind-play into other null cards. And *Slot Finesses* use *Positional Clues* to get non-null cards to play into other non-null cards.
* For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice had a *Free Choice* between cluing red and cluing number 2. If Bob really had a red 1 on his *Finesse Position*, then Alice would clue red. Thus, this must be a *Rank Choice Positional Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card as a null 1. Instead, it is the red 1 and it successfully plays. Bob now knows that this must be a *Positional Layered Finesse*, so Bob marks his slot 3 card as the null 1.
  * Cathy knows that since Bob played slot 2 instead of slot 1, this must be a *Positional Clue*. However, Cathy also knows that you are only supposed to use *Positional Clues* to get null cards. So this must be a *Positional Layered Finesse* on Bob.
  * However, from Cathy's perspective, Bob has no null cards, so Alice must have been intending something else. If Cathy does nothing, then Bob will go on to misplay his slot 3 card as a null 1. Cathy knows that since a red 1 matches a number 2 clue, then this must be a *Slot Finesse*.
  * Cathy plays her 2 as a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Bob knows that cards clued as part of *Positional Clues* are not promised to be playable, so it was very strange that Cathy played her 2. This must mean that he does not have the null 1 after all and that Alice's clue was simply a *Slot Finesse*.
```

**The Slot Double Bluff** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if a *Positional Clue* is used to get a non-null card, then the blind-playing player would continue blind-playing cards as a *Positional Layered Finesse*. For that reason, it is normally impossible to *just* get a non-null card with a *Positional Clue*.
* One way to get the blind-playing player to stop searching for a null card is to perform a *Slot Finesse* (see above).
* One other way to get the blind-playing player to stop searching for a null card is to force the next player after that to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card (in the exact same way as a *Pestilent Double Bluff*). After seeing the second blind-play, the first player will know that it is impossible for them to have a layered null card.
* For example, in a 4-player game of the "Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob does not see anyone else have any red cards. And Bob knows that *Double Self-Finesses* are turned off in null variants, so this must be a *Positional Clue*.
  * Slot 4 is Bob's chop, so normally Bob would treat this as a *Positional Save Clue* on a null 5. However, Bob currently has a globally-known playable blue 2 in his hand on slot 1 (e.g. he is *Loaded*). That means that this is a *Loaded Play Clue* and that he has a playable null 2 on his slot 4.
  * Bob blind-plays slot 4 as null 2. It is instead a green 2 and it successfully plays. Bob now knows that this must be a *Positional Inverted Layered Finesse*, so Bob marks his slot 3 card as the null 2.
  * Cathy sees that since Bob did not play a null card, Bob will assume an *Positional Inverted Layered Finesse* and will go on to play his slot 3 on his next turn. However, Bob does not have any null cards in his hand. Alice must have intended for something else to happen.
  * Cathy knows that this must be a *Slot Double Bluff*, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as any playable card. It is yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Donald knows that from the sequence of events that Alice performed a *Slot Double Bluff*, so the 4 clue is to be treated as a *Positional Clue* (e.g. the 4 in his hand might be trash).
  * Bob sees that since Cathy blind-played her *Finesse Position* card for "no reason", he must not actually have the null 2 in his hand after all. Bob can reason that Alice performed a *Slot Double Bluff*.
```

**Bubblegum Wraparound**

```
* This convention applies to any variant with a pink suit.
* When players violate *Pink Promise* on an unplayable pink card, it usually indicates a *Bubblegum Prompt* or a *Bubblegum Finesse* (with the rank corresponding to the slot number to play).
* In 4-player and 5-player games, there are only 4 cards in the hand. If a player does a *Bubblegum Finesse* with a 5, then that would be nonsensical, since there is no slot 5.
* Similarly, in a 6-player game, there are only 3 cards in the hand. If a player does a *Bubblegum Finesse* with a 4, then that would be nonsensical, since there is no slot 4.
* In this situation, it should "wraparound" to slot 1, communicating that the first slot is playable.
* This kind of thing is useful in some edge-case scenarios (e.g. helping satisfy *Good Touch Principle* in variants with a light pink suit).
```

**Bubblegum Slides**

```
* This convention applies to any variant with a pink suit.
* If a *Bubblegum Prompt* or a *Bubblegum Finesse* is telling a player to play a card in a slot that has negative pink, then that is nonsensical.
* In this situation, if there is no other possible interpretation for the clue other than a *Bubblegum Prompt* or a *Bubblegum Finesse*, and it is unlikely for the cluer to be making a mistake, then the target slot should "slide" to the right.
* If the slot immediately to the right is also impossible to be a pink card, then it should continue to slide right until it finds a pink card, wrapping around to the other side of the hand if necessary.
```

**Order Chop Move Change**

```
* This convention applies to the "Dual-Color (6 Suits)" variant.
* Normally, *Order Chop Moves*, are "turned off" when two different 1's have different positive clues on them.
  * For example, Order Chop Moves would be "turned off" in the situation where Alice has one 1 has a positive 1 clue on it, and Alice has another 1 with a positive 1 clue on it and a positive red clue on it.
* In the "Dual Color (6 Suit)" variant, *Order Chop Moves* are never turned off when there are two different 1's, regardless of different positive or negative color clues on them.
* The only exception is when the exact identity of the 1 is known (e.g. from being completely "filled in"). In this situation, *Order Chop Moves* are turned off.
```
