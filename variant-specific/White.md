# Specific Conventions for White

These conventions apply to any variant with a white (colorless) suit.

<br />

### White Compromise (5 Chop Moves)

- When you clue a white 5 that is one-away from chop, it would normally look like a *5's Chop Move*.
- However, if the white 4 is currently played, all 5 clues that could be *5's Chop Moves* are treated instead *Play Clues* on white 5.

### White Compromise (5 Pulls)

- When you clue a white 5 in the *Early Game* that is two or more away from chop, it would normally look like a *5 Pull*.
- However, if there are white cards visible and it could be a *Finesse* on the white 5, then it should be treated as a *Finesse* instead of a *5 Pull*.
