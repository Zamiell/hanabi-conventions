# Specific Conventions for White

These conventions apply to any variant with a white (colorless) suit.

<br />

### White Compromise (5 Chop Moves)

- When you clue a white 5 that is one-away from chop, it would normally look like a *5's Chop Move*.
- However, if the white 4 is currently played, all 5 clues that could be *5's Chop Moves* are treated instead *Play Clues* on white 5.

### White Compromise (5 Pulls)

- When you clue a white 5 in the *Early Game* that is two or more away from chop, it would normally look like a *5 Pull*.
- However, if there are white cards visible and it could be a *Finesse* on the white 5, then it should be treated as a *Finesse* instead of a *5 Pull*.

### White Loaded Play Clues

- A rank clue focusing a player's chop should be interpreted as a *White Loaded Play Clue* if the recipient is loaded, the focused card could be white, and at least one of the following is true:
  
  1. The white card of the rank clued is playable.
  2. The white card of the rank clued is critical, or this was a 2 clue.
- The one exception to the above is for saving 5's in *Early Game*. A clue to a 5 on chop in *Early Game* is not interpreted as a *White Loaded Play Clue* even if the 5 may be white.
- For example, in a 3-player game (*White Loaded Play Clue*):
  - White 2 is on the stacks, green 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a clued playable 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues Bob 3 to Bob's chop.
  - Bob notices that white 3 is playable and that he is loaded, so Bob determines that this is a *White Loaded Play Clue*. Bob writes white 3 on his recently clued card and plays it correctly
- For example, in a 3-player game (*White Loaded Play Clue*):
  - White 1 is on the stacks, white 3 and green 3 are in the trash.
  - Bob has a clued playable 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues Bob 3 to Bob's chop.
  - Bob notices that white 3 is in the trash, which means that this clue could be a save on a white card. Bob determines that this is a *White Loaded Play Clue* and writes white 3 on his recently clued card.
  - Bob doesn't see white 2 on Cathy's finesse, so writes white 2 on his own finesse and plays it correctly
- For example, in a 3-player game (Not a *White Loaded Play Clue*):
  - White 1 is on the stacks, green 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a clued playable 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues Bob 3 to Bob's chop.
  - Bob notices that there is no white 3 in the trash and white 2 is not playable. Bob determines that this is not a *White Loaded Play Clue* and writes green 3 on his recently clued card.
