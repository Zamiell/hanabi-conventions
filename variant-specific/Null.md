# Specific Conventions for Null

These conventions apply to any variant with a null (touched by no clues) suit.

<br />

### Hard Variant

- Any variant with a null suit is treated as a *Hard Variant*, meaning that *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" and so forth.

<br />

### Positional Clues

#### 1) What is a *Positional Clue*?

- *Positional Clues* correspond to a slot number.
- A **number** positional clue corresponds directly to the slot number.
  - For example, a number 3 clue equals slot 3.
  - In a 4-player, 5-player game, or 6-player game a number 5 clue equals *Chop Move* (since there is no slot 5 card).
- A **color** positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from right to left**.
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the *Null (6 Suit)* variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.
  - More examples for *Color Positional Clues* are listed below in a separate section. (*Color Positional Clues* have a dedicated section since they are a bit more complicated.)

#### 2) Do I discard cards touched as a *Positional Clue*?

- *Good Touch Principle* does **not** apply to cards touched as *Positional Clues*. They should be discarded exactly like an unclued card would.
  - The exception to this is if the card is known to be useful to the team (e.g. a 3 when no 3's are currently played).

#### 3) Specifically, what kinds of moves are "turned off" in favor of being a *Positional Clue*?

- Any clue that looks like one of the following is now a *Positional Clue* instead:
  - a *Double Finesse* or a *Triple Finesse* where one player has to blind-play **two or more** cards
  - a *Double Bluff* or a *Triple Bluff*
  - an *Ejection* or a *Discharge*
  - a *Rank Choice Finesse* or a *Rank Choice Bluff*
  - a *5 Pull* or a *Trash Pull*
  - a *Trash Push*
  - a *Black 4 Bluff* (with black)
  - a *Finesse* or *Bluff* that was initiated with a rank clue when a ***Free Choice*** was available between rank and color
- Additionally, any clue that has no "normal" conventional interpretation is also a *Positional Clue*.

#### 4) Are *Positional Clues* a *Save Clue* or a *Play Clue*?

- A *Positional Clue* can be either a *Save Clue* or a *Play Clue*:
  - If the slot corresponds to the chop of a player, then they have to respect that it could be a *Save Clue*. In other words, it could be a *2 Save* on a null 2, a *5 Save* on a null 5, or a save on a critical null 3 or null 4 (if the other copy is in the trash).
  - If the slot corresponds to a slot that is not on the chop, then it is a *Play Clue*.
  - However, *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to *Positional Clues*, even in the *Early Game*. (This means that you cannot ever give a *Positional Save Clue* to a player that has one or more known-playable cards.)

#### 5) Can I use *Positional Clues* to get non-null cards?

- *Positional Clues* are confusing and we want to limit that confusion as much as possible. Players should **only** use *Positional Clues* to get null cards. (Some special exceptions are listed below in the *Positional Finesses* section.)
- *Positional Clues* are "turned off" once all of the null cards have been played. Once that happens, *Double Finesses*, *Ejections*, and so forth are turned back on.

#### 6) How about an example?

- For example, in a 3-player null game:
  - On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy about one 4.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *4's Double Bluff*. But *Double Bluffs* are turned off in variants with a null suit.
  - Bob instead knows that this is a *Positional Clue*, indicating that someone should play their slot 4 card.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's slot 4 card is not a null card, so he plays his slot 4 card as the null 1.

#### 7) Do you have to be in *Bluff Seat* to give a *Positional Clue*?

- *Positional Clues* do **not** have to be given in *Bluff Seat*. They can be given by anyone, since the other players will see that the clue does not apply to them.
- Subsequently, *Positional Clues* must be played into as soon as possible, similar to a *Finesse*. If one player ignores the *Positional Clue*, then the next player will blind-play something as an *Ambiguous Positional Clue*.
- For example, in a 3-player null game:
  - On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy about one 4.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *4's Double Bluff*. But *Double Bluffs* are turned off in variants with a null suit.
  - Bob instead knows that this is a *Positional Clue*, indicating that someone should play their slot 4 card.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's slot 4 card is a null 1, so he knows that this is a positional clue on Cathy.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card.

<br />

### Color Positional Clues

- A color positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from right to left**.
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the *Null (6 Suit)* variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the *Null (5 Suit)* variant, there are 4 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a blue clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a green clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.

#### Color Positional Clues Skip Over Clued Cards

- When players are determining which slot number the *Color Positional Clue* is talking about, they should always skip over any cards that have one or more positive clues on them. (But they should not skip over cards that are considered to be "untouched" from a *Positional Clue*.)
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  - Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, red 1, null 1, blue 1, blue 5`
  - Bob's blue 5 has a number 5 clue on it. (It was clued with a *5 Save* earlier on.)
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a green 1.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*. But all *Discharges* are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a *Null Positional Clue*.
  - Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, green would refer to slot 4, since there are 5 slots in the hand and green is the 2nd rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 5 card already has a clue on it, he should skip over that card. So this must be targeting his slot 3 (e.g. his 2nd rightmost unclued slot).
  - Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 3.

#### Color Positional Clues Wrap Around

- *Color Positional Clues* always "wrap around" to the oldest card. In other words, if they go "past" slot 1, then they would apply to slot 5 again.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  - Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `null 1, red 1, red 5, blue 5, green 5`
  - All of Bob's 5's have a number 5 clue on them. (They were clued with a *5 Save* earlier on.)
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*. But all *Discharges* are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a *Null Positional Clue*.
  - Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, red would refer to slot 2, since there are 5 slots in the hand and red is the 4th rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 card already have a clue on it, he should skip over those cards.
  - This means that blue would target slot 2 and green would target slot 1. Yellow would target slot 2 again (because of the wraparound) and red would target slot 1.
  - Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 1.

#### One-of-Each Colors Are Skipped

- One-of-each colors are skipped over when finding the "rightmost color". This is because the right-most color is the most important color, and one-of-each colors are less likely to be around.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Black & Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  - Everyone has 5 cards in their hand.
  - There are 5 possible colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and black.
  - Normally, the rightmost color would be black, meaning that black would be assigned to slot 5. But black is skipped over, so blue is assigned to slot 5.
  - Subsequently, green is assigned to slot 4, yellow is assigned to slot 3, and red is assigned to slot 2.
  - Black is then assigned to slot 1. (In a 4-player game with 4 cards in the hand, then black would wrap-around and be assigned to the oldest slot again.)

<br />

### Null Saves

Some additional rules apply to *Positional Clues* that are intended to be *Save Clues*.

#### Relaxed 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give *Save Clues* to null 2's.
- Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any *Elimination Notes* for them.

#### No Early Null 3 or Null 4 Saves

- It is considered illegal to perform any kind of *Chop Move* on a non-critical null 3 or a non-critical null 4.
  - This rule counts for both *Positional Saves* and normal *Chop Moves* (such as the *5's Chop Move*).
- Thus, when a player is *Chop Moved* early on for a null card, they can know for sure that it is either a null 2 or a null 5.

<br />

### Positional Finesses

#### The Positional Finesse

- *Positional Clues* can also be used to *Finesse* a null card into a null card.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice gives a *Positional Clue* to Bob indicating that he should play his slot 3.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a null 1 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, he marks his slot 3 card as either null 1 or null 2. Bob discards.
  - Cathy sees that Bob has a null 2 on his slot 3 and that Cathy has indicated that it is playable. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as null 1.
  - Bob now knows that he has a null 2 on his slot 3.

#### The Positional Layered Finesse

- Normally, *Positional Clues* are only allowed to "get" null cards.
- Thus, if a player plays a card from a *Positional Clue* and it is not a null card, then they know to keep playing their next slot as a *Positional Layered Finesse*.

#### The Positional Inverted Layered Finesse

- Normally, if a *Positional Clue* gets a non-null card, then the player knows to keep playing their next slot as a *Positional Layered Finesse*.
- However, what if the *Positional Clue* already indicated the right-most unclued slot? In this situation, the *Layered Finesse* is supposed to go backwards, and the player should playing cards upwards.

#### The Positional Bounce Finesse

- Normally, in a *Positional Layered Finesse*, a player will blind-play cards in a rightward direction until they find the null target card.
- However, what if a player in the middle of a *Positional Layered Finesse* plays their chop and it successfully plays but it is not be a null card?
- In this circumstance, the player should **not** stop blind-playing. They should go on to play their new chop card, similar to a *Positional Inverted Layered Finesse*.
- This is called a *Bounce Finesse* because it drops all the way down and then bounces back up.

### The Slot Finesse

- Normally, if a *Positional Clue* is used to get a non-null card, then the blind-playing player would continue blind-playing cards as a *Positional Layered Finesse*. For that reason, it is normally impossible to *just* get a non-null card with a *Positional Clue*.
- As a rare exception, players can perform a *Finesse* using a *Positional Clue* that has the blind-play "match" the card that was clued. If they match, then **no null cards are promised**.
- This is called a *Slot Finesse* to distinguish it from a *Positional Finesse*. In other words, *Positional Finesses* use *Positional Clues* to get null cards to blind-play into other null cards. And *Slot Finesses* use *Positional Clues* to get non-null cards to play into other non-null cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice had a *Free Choice* between cluing red and cluing number 2. If Bob really had a red 1 on his *Finesse Position*, then Alice would clue red. Thus, this must be a *Rank Choice Positional Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card as a null 1. Instead, it is the red 1 and it successfully plays. Bob now knows that this must be a *Positional Layered Finesse*, so Bob marks his slot 3 card as the null 1.
  - Cathy knows that since Bob played slot 2 instead of slot 1, this must be a *Positional Clue*. However, Cathy also knows that you are only supposed to use *Positional Clues* to get null cards. So this must be a *Positional Layered Finesse* on Bob.
  - However, from Cathy's perspective, Bob has no null cards, so Alice must have been intending something else. If Cathy does nothing, then Bob will go on to misplay his slot 3 card as a null 1. Cathy knows that since a red 1 matches a number 2 clue, then this must be a *Slot Finesse*.
  - Cathy plays her 2 as a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob knows that cards clued as part of *Positional Clues* are not promised to be playable, so it was very strange that Cathy played her 2. This must mean that he does not have the null 1 after all and that Alice's clue was simply a *Slot Finesse*.

### The Slot Double Bluff

- Normally, if a *Positional Clue* is used to get a non-null card, then the blind-playing player would continue blind-playing cards as a *Positional Layered Finesse*. For that reason, it is normally impossible to *just* get a non-null card with a *Positional Clue*.
- One way to get the blind-playing player to stop searching for a null card is to perform a *Slot Finesse* (see above).
- One other way to get the blind-playing player to stop searching for a null card is to force the next player after that to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card (in the exact same way as a *Pestilent Double Bluff*). After seeing the second blind-play, the first player will know that it is impossible for them to have a layered null card.
- For example, in a 4-player game of the "Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob does not see anyone else have any red cards. And Bob knows that *Double Self-Finesses* are turned off in null variants, so this must be a *Positional Clue*.
  - Slot 4 is Bob's chop, so normally Bob would treat this as a *Positional Save Clue* on a null 5. However, Bob currently has a globally-known playable blue 2 in his hand on slot 1 (e.g. he is *Loaded*). That means that this is a *Loaded Play Clue* and that he has a playable null 2 on his slot 4.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 4 as null 2. It is instead a green 2 and it successfully plays. Bob now knows that this must be a *Positional Inverted Layered Finesse*, so Bob marks his slot 3 card as the null 2.
  - Cathy sees that since Bob did not play a null card, Bob will assume an *Positional Inverted Layered Finesse* and will go on to play his slot 3 on his next turn. However, Bob does not have any null cards in his hand. Alice must have intended for something else to happen.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a *Slot Double Bluff*, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as any playable card. It is yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald knows that from the sequence of events that Alice performed a *Slot Double Bluff*, so the 4 clue is to be treated as a *Positional Clue* (e.g. the 4 in his hand might be trash).
  - Bob sees that since Cathy blind-played her *Finesse Position* card for "no reason", he must not actually have the null 2 in his hand after all. Bob can reason that Alice performed a *Slot Double Bluff*.

### Other Special Moves

### The Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)

- Sometimes, a player will have two critical cards in a row on chop. Usually, the team will work together to clue both of the cards. However, in variants with a null suit, it is sometimes difficult to do this.
- In cases where one player needs to save two cards at once, they can perform a *Scream Blind-Play* by blind-playing their chop card. This is similar to a *Scream Discard*, except it *Chop Moves* two cards instead of one.
- Just like the *Scream Discard*, the *Scream Blind-Play* is only to be used as a last resort. This should be obvious, since it uses up a strike.
