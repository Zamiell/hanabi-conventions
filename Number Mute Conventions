### Number Mute Conventions (for 3 or more players)

### ● General Principles

1. This is a hard variant, which means no _DDA_, no _5 Stall_ (of course, lol), _Loaded Play Clue_ is on, etc.
2. Good Touch Principle does not apply to this variant. You should always discard your rightmost card unless it's got cm'ed or saved.
3. No _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and any convention required to blind-play two or more cards.

### ● About Turn 1 Stalls

1. Any clue given to the **next player** is either a Save Clue (touching the chop) or a Stall Clue (touching the other cards) in turn 1.
2. However, if the next player who receives a _Stall Clue_ sees another **Play Clue** available to give, then the _"Stall Clue"_ should be treated as a _Play Clue_. (Same logic as a 5 Pull.)
3. Any other clue on other players is treated as a _Play Clue_.
> Notes: No _Play Clue_ in 2-player game in turn 1.

### ● About Play Clues: Number Mute Positional Clue Rules

> To minimize confusion: The player who receives the clue is usually (not always) the person who needs to play a card from the positional clue.

### ● About Stall Clues (8 Clue Stalls or DDA Stalls if the team agreed to play with that)

Notes: You must give a clue to the **next player** to perform a _Stall Clue_; or it is always treated as a _Play Clue_ (if you give a clue to other players).
1. If the next player has no clued cards in hands, then the case is treated as _Turn 1 Stalls_. (i.e. a _Save Clue_ touching the card on chop or a _Stall Clue_ touching the other cards)
2. If the next player has clued cards in hands but with only one color, then you should clue the same color as a _Stall Clue_; otherwise, it is treated as a _Play Clue_.
3. If the next player has clued cards with two or more colors, then you should give the "rightmost" color clue as a _Stall Clue_; otherwise, it is treated as a _Play Clue_.
> For example, in 5 suits, Bob has unknown red and green cards in hand. Alice is in 8 clues situation, if she clues red to Bob, it is just a stall clue; however, if she gives a clue with any other color (to Bob), including a green clue, it is a play clue.

### ● About Saves

1. Any clue touching the _Chop_ on the **next player** is always a _Save Clue_.
2. You are only allowed to give a _Save Clue_ when you are on the _**Save Seat**_ (the person directly before the player who receives a _Save Clue_).
3. Notes: To save two critical cards in a row, use _Misplay Chop Move_.
> For example, in 5 suits in 3-player, all 1 has played on the stacks. Bob has a yellow 1 (on slot 3), a purple 5 (on slot 4), and a critical red 4 (on slot 5). Alice clues yellow to Bob. Bob misplays the yellow 1 from slot 3, then he chop moves slot 4 and 5. 

### ● About Discards

1. Good Touch Principle does not apply in Number Mutes, which means you should always discard the right-most card unless it has got chop moved or saved.

### ● Other Advanced Strategies

### 1. Delayed Play Clues (we might call it "Focus Slides")
Like Null Conventions, the target of "delayed play clues" slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.

> For example: Alice discards. Bob clues Cathy "blue" touching a card on slot 1 (telling her to play "slot 1"). If that blue card was playable, Alice would clue Cathy on Alice's turn, which implies Cathy doesn't have a playable card on slot 1, then she realizes it is a _Focus Slides_ and blind-plays her slot 2.

### 2. Stacked Play Clues
If the same color is clued again before you play the target that was gotten last turn, it means there is another playable card "stacked" behind the gotten card.

> For example: Alice clues blue to Bob (means play slot 1). Bob clues something to Alice. Alice clues Bobs "blue" again, which means Bob has another playable card on slot 2.
