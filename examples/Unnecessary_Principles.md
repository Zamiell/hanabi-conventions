* Animex52 notices that pianoblook could have clued r3 directly, and also plays slot 1 because of the *Unnecessary Trash Push*

### Example 2
![Example 2 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles2.png)
* Dr_Kakashi clues 1 to kimbifille, letting Lilliana play slot 1 as a *Trash Bluff*
* Kyle plays r1
* kimbifille notices that Lilliana's b2 could have been clued directly, and therefore also plays slot 1 as a *Trash Push*

### Example 3
![Example 3 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles3.png)
* Dr_Kakashi clues red to kimbifille, letting Lilliana play b4 as an *Unknown Trash Discharge*
* Kyle sees that black 1 will play, and therefore does not need to play slot 1 as a cancellation blind play
* kimbifille sees that Dr_Kakashi could have easily clued b4 (using rank) and therefore blind plays slot 2 as a *Trash Push*

### Example 4
![Example 4 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles4.png)
* Floriman clues r to scharkbite (green 5 was chop moved earlier), this card is known trash to all
* Kyle plays brown 3 as a *Trash Push Finesse*
* scharkbite plays brown 4 to complete the *Trash Push Finesse*
* pianoblook notices that Floriman could have clued brown 4 directly, which also would have let the same cards play. Therefore pianoblook also plays slot 1 as a *Unnecessary Trash Push Finesse*
