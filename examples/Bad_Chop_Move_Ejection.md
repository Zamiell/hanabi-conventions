![Example Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/bad_chop_move_ejection.png)

- It is pianoblook's turn. He gives a 1 clue to piper touching two 1s on slot 2 and 3.
- Now, it's IAMJEFF's turn. If he does nothing, piper would *Chop Move* the blue 2 as a *Trash Chop Move*. However, that blue 2 is also a trash.
- If IAMJEFF blind-plays his slot 1, then Dr_Kakashi would bomb his slot 1 as a *Double Ignition*. Therefore, IAMJEFF has to blind-play his slot 2 as a *Bad Chop Move Ejection*.
