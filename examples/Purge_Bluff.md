## Examples of the Purge Bluff

### Example 1

* It is Fireheart's turn.
* Fireheart clues green to Micerang. This "fills in" green 4, which is a signal to Zamiel that the green 4 is playable right now.
* Zamiel has a 2 in his hand that could be green 2. Thus, Zamiel interprets the green clue as a *Prompt* on the green 2 + a *Finesse* on the green 3.
* Zamiel plays his slot 4 card as a green 2 and it successfully plays.
* Micerang knows that no-one has the green 3, because he now has negative green on his entire hand. Micerang knows that Zamiel will think that he has the green 3 and will go on to blind-play the blue 2. After playing the blue 2, Zamiel will assume that a *Layered Finesse* is occuring, and Zamiel will go on to blind-play the null 1. After that, Zamiel will know that he was *Purge Bluffed*.
