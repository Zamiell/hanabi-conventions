- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn. He gives a 5 clue to pianoblook touching two 5s on slot 1 and 2. It is a *5 Pull* on pianoblook, since it is a hard variant.
- Now, it's piper's turn. He sees that the pulled card is not playable nor one-away-from-playable. It's a two-away card! If he does nothing, pianoblook is going to bomb the rainbow 3.
- By convention, it is a *5 Discharge* since the pulled card is a two or more away. However, piper also sees that IAMJEFF has a rainbow 2 on his *Finessed Position*, which means the rainbow 3 becomes a "one-away" card if piper has a rainbow 1 on his *Finesse Position*.
- piper blind-plays his *Finessed Position* as a *5 Pull Double Finesse*. It is a rainbow 1 and it successfully plays.
- IAMJEFF is surprised that piper blind-plays his slot 1 instead of slot 3 as a *5 Discharge*. It must be a *5 Pull Double Finesse*! Then he blind-plays his *Finessed Position* as a rainbow 2.
- Finally, pianoblook blind-plays his slot 3 as a *5 Pull Double Finesse*.
