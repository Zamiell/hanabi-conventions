## Examples of the [Safety Charm](https://github.com/pianoblook/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-safety-charm-declined-5-pull)

### Example 1

* It is the first turn of the game and ADrone starts.
* ADrone clues number 1 to wortel, touching the single blue 1.
* The next player is Floriman. Floriman can see that this is a clearly *Declined 5 Pull*, since wortel would have been able to unambiguously decipher the 5 clue as a *Pull*, not a *Stall*.
* Therefore, Floriman knows this is calling on him to *Charm*.
* Floriman blind-plays his slot 4, yellow 1.
* wortel now understands that this was a *Safety Charm*; Floriman's blind-play promises wortel a 5 on slot 1 (the next unclued card directly to the left of the 1)

### Example 2

* It is the first turn of the game and nydus starts.
* Instead of cluing both 1's in RJW's hand, nydus opts to clue RJW's singular blue 1 instead.
* The next player is gnomesayin. gnomesayin sees that nydus chose a clearly declined *5 Pull* clue.
* gnomesayin plays their *Fourth Finesse Position* as a *Safety Charm*
* RJW now knows they must have a 5 on slot 1
