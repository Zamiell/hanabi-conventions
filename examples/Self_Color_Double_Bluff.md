- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Dr_Kakashi clues black to Kyle, which "fill in" the black 5. (It was already touched by a number 5 clue early on in the game.)
- Kyle knows that Dr_Kakashi is not in a stalling situation, so this must be a *Self Color Bluff*. Kyle blind-plays his *Finesse Position* as a *Known Bluff*. It is a yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
- kimbifille knows that the black 5 is *three-away-from-playable*, so Dr_Kakashi must be intending for a *Self Color Double Bluff* (instead of a single *Bluff*). Kimbifille blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Double Bluff*. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
