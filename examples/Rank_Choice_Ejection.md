![Example Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/rank_choice_ejection.png)

- It is IAMJEFF's turn. He gives a 5 clue to pianoblook touching the rainbow 5 on *Chop*.
- Now, it's piper's turn. He knows that IAMJEFF has *Free Choice* between a color clue (blue clue, for example) and a 5 clue.
- If piper does nothing, pianoblook is going to treat it as a *5 Save*, which is quite bad. If piper blind-plays his *Finessed Position*, it still looks like a one-away 5.Therefore, piper has to blind-play his *Second Finessed Position* as a *Rank Choice Ejection*.
