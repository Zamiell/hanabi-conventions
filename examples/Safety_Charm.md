## Examples of the [Safety Charm](../Reference.md#the-safety-charm-declined-5-pull)

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/img/examples/safety_charm1.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and Alice starts.
- Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching the single blue 1.
- The next player is Bob. Bob can see that this is a clearly *Declined 5 Pull*, since Cathy would have been able to unambiguously decipher a 5 clue as a *Pull*, not a *Stall*.
- Therefore, Bob knows this is calling on him to *Charm*.
- Bob blind-plays his slot 4, yellow 1.
- Cathy now understands that this was a *Safety Charm*. Floriman's blind-play promises Cathy a 5 on slot 1 (the next unclued card directly to the left of the 1).
