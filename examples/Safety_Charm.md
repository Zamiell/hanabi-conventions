## Examples of the [Safety Charm](../Reference.md#the-safety-charm-declined-5-pull)

### Example 1

- It is the first turn of the game and Alice starts.
- ADrone clues number 1 to Cathy, touching the single blue 1.
- The next player is Bob. Bob can see that this is a clearly *Declined 5 Pull*, since Cathy would have been able to unambiguously decipher a 5 clue as a *Pull*, not a *Stall*.
- Therefore, Bob knows this is calling on him to *Charm*.
- Bob blind-plays his slot 4, yellow 1.
- Cathy now understands that this was a *Safety Charm*. Floriman's blind-play promises Cathy a 5 on slot 1 (the next unclued card directly to the left of the 1).

### Example 2

- It is the first turn of the game and Alice starts.
- Instead of cluing both 1's in Donald's hand, Alice opts to clue his singular blue 1 instead.
- The next player is Bob. Bob sees that Alice chose a clearly declined *5 Pull* clue.
- Bob plays his *Fourth Finesse Position* as a *Safety Charm*.
- Donald now knows they must have a 5 on slot 1.
