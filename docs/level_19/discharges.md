title: Discharges
---

- A *Discharge* refers to a *Signal Shift* blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Third Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Third Finesse Position* is slot 3.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge

- The *Unknown Trash Discharge* is introduced at [level 15](level_15.md#the-unknown-trash-discharge-1-for-1-form-utd).
- This results in a *Signal Shift* from *Play* --> *Trash*.

### 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

- The *5 Number Discharge* is introduced in [level 15](level_15.md#5-number-discharge-5nd).
- This results in a *Signal Shift* from *Play* --> *Trash* (on the *5 Pulled* card).

### Trash Push Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](level_14.md#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is on chop, it communicates a *Trash Push*.
- However, what if the *Trash Pushed* card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Discharge* on the very next player.
- This move is extremely similar to the *Unknown Trash Discharge*. In UTD, the focus of the clue is promised as trash. In the *Trash Push Discharge*, the *Trash Pushed* card is promised as trash.

### Prophetic Trash Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Prophetic Trash Finesse](special_finesses.md#the-prophetic-trash-finesse-for-1s).
- If a player gives a color clue to a single card, while a different player currently holds that same card on *Finesse Position*, this must be communicating something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should treat this clue as if were an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
- This is a *Prophetic* blind-play: in order for the clued card to have been considered trash, a teammate is therefore promised to have a matching copy on *Finesse Position* (note that this can also be *Layered*).
- Unlike the *Prophetic Trash Finesse* form, the clued player should **only** treat this as *Unnecessary* if the *Discharged* card could have been cleanly clued.
