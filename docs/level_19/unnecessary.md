title: Unnecessary Usage of Complicated Moves
---

- Some complicated moves have special versions that are defined as *unnecessary*.
- For example, it is possible to perform either a *Trash Bluff* or an *Unnecessary Trash Bluff*.
- This section covers these kinds of moves in detail.

### The Definition of Unnecessary

- Experienced players will know about all sorts of tricky ways to "get" cards - the *Trash Bluff*, the *Trash Finesse*, the *Unknown Trash Discharge*, the *Trash Push*, *Double Play Ejection*, and so forth.
- In most cases, these complicated moves end up being a 1-for-1, which is not very efficient. Consider that doing a complicated move like a *Trash Bluff* as a 1-for-1 is pretty pointless if the cluer can instead just give a direct *Play Clue* to the card that needs to be played as a 1-for-1. Giving "normal" *Play Clues* is much more straightforward and has much less of a margin for error!
- Therefore, advanced moves are generally used in situations where the card that needs to be played is hard to clue directly. For example:
  - It could be "blocked" by other cards (e.g. two of the same card in the hand).
  - It could be on chop and "blocked" in the sense that any clue given would look like a *Save Clue* instead of a *Play Clue*.
  - And so on.
- **An *unnecessary* move is defined as a "complicated" move that is performed when the cluer could have instead given a direct play clue.**
- *Unnecessary* moves do "one thing extra" on top of the normal meaning of the move.
  - Depending on the situation, the "extra" thing will be an additional blind-play or a *Chop Move*.
- Remember that a move is only *unnecessary* if it does not have any side benefits. Specifically:
  - A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it "picked up" a extra useful card (e.g. *Unknown Trash Discharges* commonly do this).
  - A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it also fixed an impending misplay or a violation of *Good Touch Principle*.
  - A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it also added more positive information to other previously-clued cards in the hand.

### Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash

- If **known trash** is used as clue target, the "extra" thing is a blind-play from *Finesse Position*. This will usually be Cathy. (e.g. Alice gives a clue, Bob blind-plays from the clue, Cathy blind-plays from the unnecessariness.)
- For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Push* in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 3's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a single 1 on Bob's slot 5 (his chop).
  - Bob knows that this is a *Trash Push* and blind-plays his slot 4. It is a red 4 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy sees that Bob has no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could easily clued red to Bob in order to "get" the red 4 in a straightforward way. That means that Alice performed an *Unnecessary Trash Push*.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position*. It is a red 5 and it successfully plays.
- For example, if an *Unnecessary Trash Push Discharge* was done, the next player should blind-play their *Third Finesse Position* (from the clue), and the next player after that should blind-play their *Finesse Position* (from the unnecessariness).
- For example, if an *Unnecessary Trash Chop Move* was done on a card that could be saved directly, the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position*, and the clue receiver should still *Chop Move*.

### Unnecessary Moves with Unknown Trash (Off-Chop)

- If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is off-chop, the "extra" thing is a *Chop Move* (e.g. a *Trash Chop Move*).
- For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2.
  - Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could give a red clue to Bob in order to "get" the red 2.
  - Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a blue 2 on slot 4. (Blue 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  - Bob knows that from Cathy's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on the final remaining 2 - the red 2. Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 2 as the red 2.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that her 2 is trash (since Bob blind-played in response to the clue). However, Cathy also knows that this *Trash Finesse* was *unnecessary*, as Alice could have just clued red to Bob.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse*, so she marks her slot 5 card as being *Chop Moved*.
- For example, if an *Unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge* was done, the next player should blind-play their *Third Finesse Position* (from the clue), and the clue receiver should *Chop Move* (from the unnecessariness).
- Importantly, note that *Unnecessary Chop Moves* are tricky in that they have **information asymmetry**: the player who blind-plays will **not** know that the card is chop moved, while everyone else will. All players will have to keep this in mind until the *Chop Move* has been demonstrated.

### Unnecessary Moves with Unknown Trash (On-Chop)

- If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is on-chop, but the clue **also** touched other trash cards in the hand that were not on chop, then the "extra" thing is a *Chop Move* (e.g. a *Trash Chop Move*), similar to the previous section.
- If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is on-chop, and the clue only touched one card (or all the cards touched were also on chop), then the "extra" thing is a blind-play (e.g. a *Trash Push*).
- For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2.
  - Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could give a red clue to Bob in order to "get" the red 2.
  - Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a blue 2 on slot 5. (Blue 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  - Bob knows that from Cathy's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on the final remaining 2 - the red 2. Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 2 as the red 2.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that her 2 is trash (since Bob blind-played in response to the clue). However, Cathy also knows that this *Trash Finesse* was *unnecessary*, as Alice could have just clued red to Bob.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse*. Normally, she would *Chop Move* something, but the focus of the clue was already on her chop. Cathy instead blind-plays her slot 4 as a *Trash Push*.

### Other Examples

- More examples of a *unnecessary* moves can be found [here](examples/unnecessary.md).

### The Unnecessary Forced Reverse Trash Finesse (A Gentleman's Discard That Looks Like an Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse)

- First, see the section on [Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash](#unnecessary-moves-with-known-trash), which defines what a *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* is. Basically, if a *Trash Finesse* is unnecessary, then it also causes a *Chop Move*.
- This convention also applies to *Reverse Trash Finesses*. If they are unnecessary, then it causes a *Chop Move* in the same way.
- If a line is chosen that forces a *Gentleman's Discard* to occur (because they have to entertain the possibility of a *Reverse Trash Finesse*), and the blind-playing card could have been clued in some other easier way, then it **still** *Chop Moves* in exactly the same way that an *Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse* would.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - This is a slightly modified version of the example given for the *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a *Play Clue*.
  - From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a *Play Clue* on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. That means that this could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  - If it is a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that *she* has a red 2.
  - Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* on Cathy.
  - Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a red 2.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob knows that even though *Gentleman's Discards* are never supposed to cause a *Chop Move*, Alice forced him to discard in exactly the same way as a *Reverse Trash Finesse*. Furthermore, it was possible to cleanly clue the red 2 in Cathy's hand to begin with, and doing so would have been much simpler. Thus, doing the pseudo-*Reverse Trash Finesse* was unnecessary.
  - Since it was unnecessary, Bob chop moves all the cards to the right of where the red 2 was (slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5).

### The Trash Push Inverted Finesse

- First, see the section on [Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash](#unnecessary-moves-with-known-trash), which defines what a *Unnecessary Trash Push* is. Basically, if a *Trash Push* is unnecessary, then it also causes an extra blind-play.
- Normally, the *Unnecessary Trash Push* calls for the very next player to blind-play an unrelated card, similar to a *Bluff*.
- However, if the very next player can see that it could be a *Finesse* through the *Trash Pushed* card, then they should prefer that interpretation. This is similar to how Bob should always prefer a *Finesse* interpretation over a *Bluff* interpretation.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of *Trash Push*.
  - Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated *Trash Push*.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Push*. Normally, Bob would immediately blind-play his *Finesse Position* card. However, Bob also sees that Donald has a red 4 in his *Finesse Position*. Since *Finesses* take precedence over *Bluffs*, Bob knows that he should let Donald be the one to blind-play from the unnecessariness.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a *Trash Push*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 3 card. It is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  - Similar to Bob, Donald also sees that the *Trash Push* was unnecessary. Since Bob did not blind-play anything, this must be a *Trash Push Inverted Finesse*. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position* as red 4 and it successfully plays.
