### The Fake Save

- We are only able to perform *Save Clues* on specific cards and in specific ways, as outlined in the Beginner's Guide. For example, we all agree that we must save 5's with number 5.
- In some specific circumstances, the team will have only one clue available and multiple cards must be saved with a single clue. In this situation, to prevent losing the game (or losing a currently-playable card), it is permissible to *Lie* to the next player and perform a *Fake Save* (e.g. a non-legal *Save Clue*).
- After a *Fake Save*, the player receiving the clue will mark their chop card as something other than what it really is. Thus, this move commits the team to giving a *Fix Clue* to repair the *Lie* at some point in the future.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has 1 clue available.
  - Bob has a red 5 on chop, followed by a red 4. The other copy of the red 4 is in the discard pile, so there are two critical cards in a row.
  - Alice is not allowed to save the red 5 with a red clue, because then it would look like a *Save Clue* on a red 4.
  - However, if Alice clues number 5 to Bob, then he will discard the red 4.
  - Thus, Alice performs a *Fake Save* on both red cards by cluing red.
  - Bob will mark his chop as the red 4, so the team will have to give him a number 5 clue as a *Fix Clue* at some point in the future. At that point, Bob will be surprised, but he will be able to retroactively see that Alice was in a very tight spot and had to give a *Fake Save*.
- Note that normally, *Fake Saves* are **only allowed as a last resort**. If there is some other line that would "work" or be safe without a *Fake Save*, then players have to prefer that. Subsequently, *Fake Saves* are extremely rare.

### The Unnecessary Generation Discard

- Sometimes, in order to satisfy *Save Principle*, a player will perform an unnecessary *Generation Discard*, which generates a clue to save a card that they actually already have in their hand.
- This puts the next player in an ambiguous situation: was it really a *Generation Discard*, or could it a *Scream Discard*? In order to cover both situations, they should not *Chop Move*, but they should also not discard on this turn.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks. No blue cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a blue 1 in her hand. She knows the exact identity of it, so it is known playable.
  - Alice also has a 4 clued in her hand. She does not know what color it is.
  - There are 0 clues, so if Alice plays the blue 1, Bob will be forced to discard.
  - Alice sees that Cathy has a red 4 on chop, which is playable. If Alice does not have red 4 in her hand, then Cathy could potentially discard the red 4 (after Bob is forced to discard).
  - So, Alice performs a *Generation Discard* to generate a clue so that Bob can clue the get the red 4, if necessary.
  - Bob sees that Alice does indeed already have the red 4 in her hand, so from his perspective, if Alice was performing a *Generation Discard*, it was unnecessary.
  - However, it could also be the case that Bob's chop is unsafe. So, Bob will **not** clue the red 4 on Cathy's chop, but he **will** spend the clue in some other productive fashion. If Bob has nothing productive to do, he must "burn" a clue, similar to what happens when a *Scream Discard* occurs.

### The Double Scream Discard Chop Move

- If a player has a known playable card and one known trash card, and then they discard the trash card instead of playing, then that is a *Scream Discard* and the next player should *Chop Move*.
- If a player has a known playable card and two known trash cards, and then they discard the oldest trash card instead of playing, then that is both a *Scream Discard Chop Move* and a *Trash Order Chop Move* at the same time.
- In this situation, the next player should *Chop Move* twice. (This is the composition of a *Scream Discard Chop Move* and a *Trash Order Chop Move*.)
