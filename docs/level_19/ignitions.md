- An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
- An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  - unrelated to the clue that was given
    - e.g. It doesn't "match", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  - unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    - e.g. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.
- Currently, there is only one type of clue that can cause an *Ignition*; see below.

### Double Ignition (with Known Trash)

- Towards the end of the game, if a player clues known trash, then there are usually 3 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known trash in another player's hand (off-chop).
- However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known trash in another player's hand (on-chop).
- However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### 3) A Late-Game Burn Clue

- Sometimes, players give meaningless *Burn Clues* to known trash cards in order to avoid drawing more cards. (This is rare, because they would normally re-clue a playable card, but sometimes it is done.)
- However, players can know that a *Burn Clue* is impossible if they see that a normal *Play Clue* could have been given instead.

#### A Double Ignition

- If the known trash clue cannot be any of these 3 things, then it communicates a *Double Ignition*, meaning that the next two players should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card.
- For the players playing into a *Double Ignition*, it is pretty easy to see what is going on, because they can see the playable *Finesse Position* card of the other person.

#### Skipping Bluff Seat

- Rarely, if Bob has a playable card, a *Double Ignition* can skip over Bob and affect Cathy and Donald.

#### Conflict with Bad Chop Move Ejection

- Technically, cluing a known trash card to *Chop Move* a "bad" card would trigger an *Ejection* (as a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*).
- In this situation, players should always assume a *Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* (since the latter is very rare).
