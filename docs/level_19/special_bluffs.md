### Known Bluffs

- Usually, when a *Bluff* occurs, the blind-playing player has no idea that is a *Bluff* - they assume they are playing a specific card into a true *Finesse*.
- However, in rare situations, a clue will be given that looks like a *Finesse*, but the next player will know for sure that they do not have the "matching" card.
- In these situations, if the next player cannot see a better explanation for the clue, then they should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*.
- For example:
  - The player might see all of the copies of the card that they are supposed to be blind-playing.
  - The player might have negative information on their entire hand (e.g. negative blue on every card when they are supposed to be blind-playing a blue 2).
  - The player might know that they are blind-playing a 1 into a *3 Bluff* (e.g. a card was clued with number 3 and there are no cards played yet).

### Hard Bluffs

- First, see the section on [How to Tell the Difference Between a Finesse and a Bluff (Part 2)](#how-to-tell-the-difference-between-a-finesse-and-a-bluff-part-2---bluffs-are-on-mismatched-cards).
- Sometimes, it can be ambiguous as to whether a player blind-played a card into a *Bluff*, or they blind-played into a *Finesse* + *Prompt*. In this situation, *Occam's Razor* applies, so players should go with the *Bluff* interpretation, since it is simpler. When such a *Bluff* occurs, it is called a *Hard Bluff* to disambiguate from situations where *Bluffs* happen with no ambiguity.
- For example, this is a *Finesse* + *Prompt* and **not** a *Hard Bluff*:
  - Only red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).
  - Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.
  - Bob blind-plays red 2.
  - In a normal *Bluff*, a *one-away-from-playable* card is clued. However, Cathy sees that the highest stack is the red stack, so the 4 in her hand must be two-away.
  - Thus, Cathy does **not** read it as a *Bluff*; she is promised red 3 and red 4, so she plays the unknown 3 as a *Self-Prompt* for the red 3.
- For example, this **is** a *Hard Bluff*:
  - Red 1 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).
  - Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.
  - Bob blind-plays red 2.
  - This could be a *Bluff* if the 4 in her hand is blue 4, since blue 4 is currently *one-away-from-playable*. Thus, Cathy **does not** assume that her 4 is red 4, and subsequently, **does not** assume that her unknown 3 is a red 3. However, it could **also** be the case that the 4 is a red 4 (if the 3 in her hand happens to be red 3).
  - Thus, Cathy marks down both possibilities for later and does not play anything right now.

### The Hard 3 Bluff

- Players can use a 3 to *3 Bluff* the 1 of the same suit.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1.
  - Bob now knows that it was a *3 Bluff* and that no-one is promised the red 2. This is because even though the red 1 is the same suit as the red 3, *3 Bluffs* take precedence over *Double Finesses* as long as the clue type (number 3) does not match the card that was blind-played (a number 1).

### The Hard 4 Double Bluff

- Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3.

### The Hard 5 Double Bluff

- Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff* and a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 5 Double Bluff*.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - It is the *Mid-Game* and all the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Emily, touching a red 5 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a red 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy blind-plays a red 3 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Donald sees that no-one else has any red cards in their hand. Thus, if this was a *Triple Finesse* on the red 5, then Donald should blind-play the red 4 right now.
  - However, Donald also knows that 5's are valid *Double Bluff* targets. Since number 3 does not match number 5, Donald knows that he should prefer the *Double Bluff* interpretation (that gets two blind-plays) over the *Triple Finesse* interpretation (that gets three blind-plays).

### Self Color Bluffs (1-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- It is possible (and fairly common) to perform a *Self-Bluff* on a player with a rank clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one brand new 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob does not see any playable cards in anyone else's hand.
  - The closest 4 to being playable is the red 4, so Bob knows that the 4 in his hand is probably a red 4.
  - Since Bob does not see any red 3's, Bob knows he must have the red 3, and he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Bob now knows that he was *Bluffed* by Alice and that the 4 in his hand is exactly red 4.
- Doing a *Self-Bluff* on a player with a color clue is a bit more weird. On the face of it, a *Self Color Bluff* would be nonsensical, since the receiving player would have negative color on the card that they are blind-playing - they would explicitly know that the blind-card cannot possibly match.
- Nonetheless, we agree that in this situation, players should blind-play a card anyway as a *Known Bluff*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which "fills in" a card with a number 4 clue on it. It is now a globally-known red 4.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red 4, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
- Note that *Self Color Bluffs* should not be confused with the more-ordinary "fill-in" clues that are used in stalling situations. (See the [Allowable Stall Clues](#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) section.) In other words, **if someone could be in a stalling situation, you should never blind-play a card from a fill-in clue**.
- *Self Color Bluffs* are not very good and should only be used sparingly, because:
  - they can be confusing
  - they almost always have an efficiency of a 1-for-1
- Expert players can use *Self Color Bluffs* as a nice alternative to giving a 1-for-1 directly to the card in *Finesse Position*. Doing so has the advantage of "filling in" an ancillary card in the hand.
- More examples of a *Self Color Bluff* can be found [here](examples/self_color_bluff.md).

### Self Color Bluff (2-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- Rarely, it is also possible to perform a *Self Color Bluff* as a 2-for-1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a brand new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red card.
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is *one-away-from-playable*).

### Self Color Double Bluff (SCDB)

- Just like normal bluffs, *Self Color Bluffs* are done by "filling in" a card that is *one-away-from-playable* or a legal *Bluff* target.
- However, players can also perform a *Self Color Double Bluff* by "filling in" a card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable* and not a legal *Bluff* target.
- For example, in a 3-player game (similar to the previous example):
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a brand new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red card, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is *one-away-from-playable*).
  - Cathy sees that Alice did a *Self Color Bluff* on Bob. However, Cathy sees that the red card in Bob's hand is the red 5, which is *two-away-from-playable*. That means that Alice means to perform a *Self Color Double Bluff* (instead of a single *Bluff*).
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob is surprised by Cathy's blind-play and realizes that it must be related to the clue that Alice gave. If Bob had a red 4 in his hand, then Cathy would not have gone on to blind-play anything. So, Bob erases his note of "red 4" and instead writes "red 5", because that is the only red card that is *two-away-from-playable*, and is the only card that would make Cathy blind-play.
- More examples of a *Self Color Double Bluff* can be found [here](examples/self_color_double_bluff.md).

### Stacked Bluffs (Exception)

- First, see the section explaining that [*Stacked Bluffs* are illegal](#stacked-bluffs-illegal).
- Rarely, a player can know that a *Layered Finesse* is impossible. This could be because they know the identity of every card in their hand (minus their *Finesse Position* card). Or, alternatively, they could have relevant negative information on their entire hand.
- If the player can rule out a *Layered Finesse*, then it is possible to perform a *Stacked Bluff* on them. It is important to note that such a player is "locked in" to the *Bluff* and should almost always immediately play their *Finesse Position* card.

### The Known Priority Bluff

- Players generally perform *Priority Bluffs* by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a *Priority Bluff* that is globally-known to be a *Bluff*. For example:
  - Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.
  - Bob has a known red 2.
  - Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  - Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Priority Finesse* on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.
  - This must be a *Known Priority Bluff*, so Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as any other playable card.

### The Elimination Bluff & The Elimination Layered Finesse

- Normally, if a player has *Elimination Notes* on their hand, you can clue the next card in the suit to perform an *Elimination Finesse*.
- It is also possible to pretend like you are performing an *Elimination Finesse* on someone in order to get an unrelated card to blind-play from their oldest slot.
- If the player who performed the clue was in *Bluff Seat*, then it is to be treated like a *Bluff*, and thus they will not know where the actual *Elimination Card* is. (However, in most cases, at this point there will only be one remaining card with an *Elimination Note* on it, so it won't matter.)
- If the player who performed the clue was not in *Bluff Seat*, then the blind-playing player is expected to keep playing until they find the intended card. This is similar to how a *Layered Finesse* works, but it is inverted such that they play cards from oldest to newest.

### The Out-of-Position Bluff (OOP) / The Reverse Bluff

- It is legal to perform a *Reverse Finesse*, but it is not legal to perform a *Reverse Bluff*, because it breaks the *Bluff Seat* rule (and violates *Lie Principle*).
  - Why this policy? It is not possible to play with both *Layered Finesses* and *Reverse Bluffs* at the same time. *Layered Finesses* are much better, so we choose to "turn on" *Layered Finesse* and "turn off" *Reverse Bluffs*.
- However, players **can** rarely break the *Bluff Seat* rule if **one of the following is true**:
  1. The next player is at 0 clues (and won't blind-play anything / will blind-play an unrelated card).
  2. The next player will think that they have the *Bluffed* card in their own hand and will not try to *Finesse* or *Bluff* the next player. (In this case, the *Bluffed* card means the card that will blind-play.)
  3. The next player has enough positive or negative clues on their entire hand to know that they cannot have the card that the blind-played card will be played as.
- Essentially, if i. or ii. is true, then the next player cannot act on their state of misinformation. And if iii. is true, then the next player will have full knowledge that a *Lie* is occurring, so they will not try to "get" the *Bluffed* card.
- Since valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* are so rare, it is important to remember that:
  - Valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* take precedence over *Known Bluffs*. In other words, if Bob can see that an *OOP Bluff* could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Bob should not blind-play anything as a *Known Bluff* and let Cathy play instead.
  - Valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* take precedence over *Layered Finesses*. In other words, if Cathy can see that an *OOP Bluff* could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Cathy should not continue to blind-play cards as a *Layered Finesse*. (This is a common mistake.)
- A *Reverse Bluff* is just a just a more-specific type of *Out-of-Position Bluff*. All of the same stipulations apply.

### The Bad Touch Double Bluff (For 3's)

- In the same way as the *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, it is also possible to *Bad Touch Double Bluff* (or *Bad Touch Double Half Bluff*) in order to get unrelated cards played from *Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching two red 3's.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is blue 1.
  - Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3's are duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Bluff*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the green 1.
  - Donald knows that he must have a duplicated copy of a 3, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything. Donald discards the left-most 3.
- Instead of cluing the same 3 in one hand, it is also possible to perform a *Bad Touch Double Finesse/Bluff* by intentionally duplicating a 3 in another player's hand.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played except for red 1.
  - Emily has a clued red 3 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching a red 3 (and duplicating it, since Emily already has a copy with a clue on it).
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is red 1.
  - Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3 was duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 2.
  - Donald knows that this cannot be a *3 Bluff*, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything. Thus, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Donald discards his red 3 as a *Sarcastic Discard* to pass it back to Emily.
  - Emily plays the red 3.
- More examples of a *Bad Touch Double Bluff* can be found [here](examples/bad_touch_double_bluff.md).

### The Pestilent Triple Bluff

- First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)*.
- Rarely, it is possible that a *Pestilent*-style clues is performed with a two-away-from-playable card instead of a *one-away-from-playable* card. In this situation, it would transform into a *Triple Bluff* instead of a *Double Bluff*.
- Note that normally, *Triple Bluffs* are explicitly illegal. But *Pestilent Triple Bluffs* are an exception to this rule.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob attempts to blind-play a red 2 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, it is a blue 2, and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that this is probably a *4's Double Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as any playable card. It is a blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald knows that Emily will go on to incorrectly think that her red 4 is a blue 4 (because Alice's clue looks like a *Double Finesse*). Thus, Alice's clue is quite strange.
  - Alice must be intending for Donald to also blind-play his *Finesse Position* in order to "heal" the problem. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a green 2 and it successfully plays.
  - At first, Emily thought that her 4 was the blue 4, in order to match the blue 2 and the blue 3. However, if that was the case, then Donald would not have blind-played anything. Emily knows that this must be a *Pestilent Triple Bluff*, and her 4 is any other 4 than blue 4 (because Donald blind-played) and green 4 (because Bob would have waited for Donald).

### The Pass Bluff

- First, see the section on the *[Hesitation Blind-Play](#the-hesitation-blind-play)*.
- It is possible for a *Hesitation Blind-Play* to occur without anyone intending it to happen. However, if a player intentionally tries to make a *Hesitation Blind-Play* occur, it is called a *Pass Bluff*.
- In other words, after a *Finesse* occurs that is directed at you, you will know that your *Finesse Position* card is playable. If the next immediate player also has an unrelated playable card on their *Finesse Position*, you can pretend like the *Finesse* wasn't directed at you. This will cause them to think that the *Finesse* was directed at them, and you will get the unrelated card played for free.
- After the unrelated card is played, the next player should **not** continue to blind-play cards (as a *Layered Finesse*) because:
  - The "passing" player fulfills the real *Finesse* on their next turn.
  - The "passing" player was in *Bluff Seat*.
- *Pass Bluffs* rely on contextual information in order to work, so the circumstances in which you can do them are narrow.
- It is illegal for a player to perform a *Pass Bluff* if they could be *Bluffed*. (This is because the first *Bluff* would not resolve immediately and would violate *Lie Principle*.)
  - Subsequently, it is also illegal for a player to pass an *Ejection* to the next player.

### The Double/Triple Pass Bluff

- After a player performs a *Pass Bluff*, when it becomes their turn again, if they see an unrelated playable card on the *Second Finesse Position* of the next player, they can perform yet another *Pass Bluff*, implying that the first *Pass Bluff* was not a *Pass Bluff* at all and instead simply a *Layered Finesse* or *Clandestine Finesse*.
- Then, after the unrelated card is played, the player who initiated the *Double Pass Bluff* can go ahead and play into the real *Finesse*.
- Alternatively, if there continue to be playable cards, they can keep *Pass Bluffing*.

### The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a *Layered Finesse* in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a *Layered Finesse* may not always be available.
- In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a *Lie* in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are *Layered Finessed* when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the matching card, they will know that they were *Purge Bluffed* and that nobody has the missing card.
- Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not *Purge Bluffed*) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a *Patch Finesse* is happening. Thus, *Purge Bluffs* can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
- If the player blind-playing cards into a *Purge Bluff* realizes that a *Lie* has occurred before they finish blind-playing their entire hand, they are supposed to stop. In other words, they are **not** supposed to continue blind-playing cards as a *Known Purge Bluff*.
- Examples of a *Purge Bluff* can be found [here](examples/purge_bluff.md).
