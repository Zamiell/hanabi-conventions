### The Selfish Finesse (A Finesse Through Your Own Hand)

- First, see the section on the *[Selfish Clue](miscellaneous.md#the-selfish-clue)*.
- One excellent reason to give a *Selfish Clue* is to "lock in" a *Finesse* before the cards move out of *Finesse Position*. This is called a *Selfish Finesse*.
- Like any other *Finesse*, players in this situation should just mark the cards for later and wait patiently for the cluer to play their card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*. (This is now a globally-known red 1, since Cathy does not have any red 1's in her hand.)
  - Bob clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Cathy sees that Alice has as red 2 on her *Finesse Position*, so this must be a *Selfish Finesse*. Bob did not want to play the red 1 because then the *Finesse* might go away and he wanted to lock it in. Cathy marks her red card as potentially red 3 and discards.
  - Alice sees that Bob gave a *Play Clue* to a red 3. Bob knows for sure that he has the red 1, so Alice must have the red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. Alice marks her *Finesse Position* card as red 2 and discards.
  - Bob plays red 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice blind-plays red 2.

### The Layered Priority Finesse

- Similar to a normal *Layered Finesse*, it is also possible to initiate a *Layered Priority Finesse* as long as the blind-playing player is not the very next person.

### The Bad Touch Layered Finesse that Causes a Blind-Play of a Known Dupe (Dupe Bluffs / Bluff Dupes)

- If a player performs a *Bluff* that causes a blind-play of a globally-known duplicated card, that is quite strange. Doing this is not very good, as it violates *Good Touch Principle* and does not accomplish very much in general.
- Players agree that this is not a *Bluff* at all, but instead a *Layered Finesse*. The player who blind-played the card should continue to blind-play cards until they find the promised card.
- This section also applies to *Priority Bluffs* that cause the blind-play of a duplicated card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a globally-known red 3 in her hand. (It is "filled in" with both a red clue and a number 3 clue.)
  - Alice clues blue to Cathy, touching a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that this must be a *Finesse*, so he attempts to blind-play a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, he blind-plays a red 3.
  - Cathy discards her chop.
  - Alice discards her known red 3 (since it is already played and is now trash).
  - Bob knows that *Bluffs* that duplicate a card like this are supposed to be treated as *Layered Finesses*. Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* as blue 3 and it successfully plays.

### Potential Priority Duplication & The Certain Priority Finesse (or Priority Certain Finesse)

- Normally, players can perform any particular type of *Finesse* either by giving a clue or by playing a card without *Priority*. For example, it is possible to both do a *Layered Finesse* (by giving a clue) and a *Layered Priority Finesse* (by playing a card).
- One exception to this rule is the *Certain Finesse*. When a player perform a *Certain Finesse*, it calls for a *Certain Discard*. However, when a player uses *Priority* to promise a card that could potentially be in their own hand, this should **not** induce a *Certain Discard*. The other players in this situation should just ignore the *Priority* and instead discard their chop card. (Doing it this way is much safer because it allow potential *Layered Finesses* as well as some slack for mistakes.)

### The No-Information Double Finesse & The No-Information Double Bluff

- Sometimes, a card that is two-away-from-playable is re-clued in order to initiate a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. Most times, the clue will "fill in" or give extra information to the existing card.
- Other times, the clue will give no information (e.g. re-cluing number 3 to an already known 3). In this situation, if it was merely a *Bluff*, it would be pretty low value.
- Thus, by convention, a "no information" clue on a two-away-from-playable card **must** "get" at least 2 new cards (as opposed to a single *Bluff* that only gets 1 brand new card).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  - Bob blind-plays red 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the red 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*. Bob sees that Cathy does not have the red 2, so he must have the red 2, and can blind-play it on his next turn.
- Usually, a "no-information" clue conveys a *Double Finesse*. But you can also use it to perform a *Double Bluff* (or a *Double Half Bluff*). For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  - Bob blind-plays green 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the green 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*.
  - Cathy sees that Bob does not have the green 2, so she must have the green 2, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, and it is yellow 1 instead of green 2.
  - Since two cards were blind-played (that did not match), everyone now knows that the *No-Information* clue was a *Double Bluff* instead of a *Double Finesse*. From Cathy's perspective, her 3 can (still) be any 3 at all.
- The "no-information" principle can also be used to perform a *No-Information Layered Finesse* on the next player. (The next player will know that it is a *Layered Finesse* instead of a *Bluff* because some other more-useful clue could have been given to initiate the *Bluff*.)

### The Bad Touch Finesse (For 1's)

- In the *Trash Finesse* / *Trash Bluff*, it is possible to clue number 1 to a player in order to get someone to blind-play a card.  After the blind-play, it is understood that all of the 1's are trash.
- However, what if this is done on the first turn of the game, touching two 1's? If nothing is played on the stacks, then the 1 of every single suit is needed. In this situation, both of the 1's that are clued cannot be trash.
- In this situation, the 1's clue only communicates that *Good Touch Principle* was violated and that both of the 1's are the same suit.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `green 4, red 1, red 1, red 5, green 5`
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching the two red 1's.
  - Bob sees that instead of violating *Good Touch Principle*, Alice could have instead simply performed a *5 Save* to Cathy.
  - Bob knows that since we are not normally supposed to violate *Good Touch Principle*, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that since this is the first turn of the game, both of her 1's cannot be trash. Similar to a *Stale 1's Clue*, Cathy skips over the older 1 and plays the newest 1. (She would normally play her 1's from right-to-left.) Cathy will then discard the other one later.
- If a *Bad Touch Finesse* is performed on three or more 1s, it only promises that the oldest one is trash / duplicated.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `green 1, red 1, red 1, red 5, green 5`
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob sees that instead of violating *Good Touch Principle*, Alice could have instead simply performed a *5 Save* to Cathy.
  - Bob knows that since we are not normally supposed to violate *Good Touch Principle*, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that since this is the first turn of the game, all of her 1's cannot be trash. Similar to a *Stale 1's Clue*, Cathy skips over the oldest 1 (on slot 3) and plays the middle 1 (on slot 2). (She would normally play her 1's from right-to-left.) On Cathy's next turn, she will play the left-most 1. On Cathy's next turn after that, she will discard the right-most 1 (the one that she originally skipped over).

### The Bad Touch Finesse (For 2's)

- Normally, if number 2 is clued to a chop card, it is considered to be a *Save Clue* (as the *2 Save* convention).
- However, it is possible for players to transform this *Save Clue* interpretation into a *Play Clue* interpretation if they violate *Good Touch Principle* and intentionally duplicate another 2.
- In this situation, the player who received the clue will know that the chop card matches.
  - If two 2's were clued, then the other 2 is obviously the exact same copy as the chop 2. In this situation, the left-most card can be played and the other card discarded as known trash.
  - If three or more 2's were clued, then any of the other cards could be the duplicated 2. In this situation, the chop card should be discarded and then *Elimination Notes* for that card written on the other 2's.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 on slot 3 and a red 2 on slot 5 (her chop).
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *2 Save* on the red 2. However, Alice is violating *Good Touch Principle*, so she must be trying to communicate something extra.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  - Cathy knows that since a clue that looks like a *2 Save* got Bob to blind-play something, then both of the 2's must be red 2. Cathy plays the 2 on slot 3 and plans to discard the 2 on slot 5 on her next turn.
- The *Bad Touch Finesse* is contextual and does not always apply:
  - If the clue giver was an *Occupied*, then it is an *Occupied Play Clue* and the other 2's are not necessarily duplicated.
  - If the clue giver gave a *2 Save* early and had other *Play Clues* to give instead, the clue could be so bad that it would trigger a *Finesse* and the other 2's are not necessarily duplicated.

### The Bad Touch Bluff (For 2's)

- In the same way as the *Bad Touch Finesse*, it is also possible to *Bad Touch Bluff* in order to get unrelated cards played from *Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 2 and green 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 on slot 3 and a red 2 on slot 5 (her chop).
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *2 Save* on the red 2. However, Alice is violating *Good Touch Principle*, so she must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, trying to play the red 1. Instead, it is is blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that since a clue that looked like a *2 Save* got Bob to blind-play something, then a duplication occurred and both of the 2's must be the same. Cathy discards the chop card and saves the other one for later.

### The Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)

- Normally, a *3 Bluff* takes priority over a *Double Finesse*. This means that if someone clues a blue 3 using the number 3, and then a blue 1 blind-plays on the very next turn, no-one is promised the blue 2.
- However, if **both** blue 3's were touched with the number 3 clue, then that would violate *Good Touch Principle*, and this would be considered a "bad touch".
- If someone is violating *Good Touch Principle*, they must have a very good reason, so the clue must be a *Double Finesse* instead of a *3 Bluff*. In the above example, the next player should blind-play the blue 2 from their *Finesse Position*.
- After that, the player who received the clue can safely discard the focused 3.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching two red 3's.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is red 1.
  - Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3's are duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 2.
  - Donald knows that the other 3 in his hand must be the other copy of red 3, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything, so Donald plays the left-most red 3. The next time that Donald discards, he will discard the known trash red 3.

### The Bad Touch Layered Finesse That Dupes a Clued Card (Illegal)

- First, see the section on the *[Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)](special_finesses.md#the-bad-touch-double-finesse-for-3s)*.
- Similar to a *Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)*, it is also possible to try a *Bad Touch Layered Finesse* on the next player.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues both copies of red 3 in Cathy's hand.
  - Bob blind-plays a blue 1.
  - Bob knows that if only one red 3 was touched, this would just be a normal *3 Bluff*. However, since there was a bad touch, he knows that he must continue to blind-play cards until he finds the red 1 and the red 2.
- *Bad Touch Layered Finesses* are **explicitly illegal** because they violate *Lie Principle* - Bob cannot demonstrate that it is a bad touch until after Cathy has already taken a turn.

### The Bad Touch Triple Finesse (For 4's)

- In the same way that it is possible to perform a *Bad Touch Double Finesse* to "get around" a *3 Bluff* interpretation, it is also possible to perform a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse* to "get around" a *4 Double Bluff* interpretation.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching two red 4's.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 2.
  - Donald knows that normally, this would be a *4 Double Bluff* and that no-one should play any more cards. However, since the red 4 was duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 3.
  - Emily knows that this cannot be a *4 Double Bluff*, or else Donald would not have blind-played anything. Thus, this must be a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse*, so Emily plays her left-most red 4. The next time that Emily discards, she will discard the known trash red 4.

### The Prophetic Trash Finesse (for 1's)

- If a player gives a rank clue to a single 1, while a different player currently holds that same 1 on *Finesse Position*, this must be communicating something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should treat this clue as if were a *Trash Finesse*. 
- This is a *Prophetic* blind-play: in order for the clued card to be considered trash, a teammate is therefore promised to have the matching 1 on *Finesse Position* (note that this can also be *Layered*).
- The clued player should **always** treat this as an *Unnecessary Trash* move. 
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, touching a single red 1 on slot 3.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1.
  - Cathy understands that she must also have red 1, on *Finesse Position*. She blind-plays red 1.
  - Donald discards his known red 1. He also *Chop Moves* his slot 4 card because of the *Unnecessary* nature of this sequence.

### The Patch Finesse

- Sometimes, a player will initiate a *Layered Finesse* on a card that is behind a *one-away-from-playable* card. Normally, this would be quite bad, as the player would blind-play the *one-away-from-playable* card, and it would misplay.
- However, since the *Finesse* target is considered unplayable from the rest of the team, they can be tricked into blind-playing the exact card that makes the one-away card actually playable. This "patches" the *Layered Finesse* problem, and now the layer can be fully unwrapped without issues.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Emily, which is a *Play Clue* on a red 4.
  - Donald has a blue 3 on his *Finesse Position*, followed by a red 2 and a red 3.
  - Bob discards. (We will return to Bob at the end.)
  - Cathy sees that she must have the red 2 and red 3 on her *Finesse Position*, because even though Donald has the red 2 and the red 3, they are behind an unplayable card (blue 3).
  - Cathy tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead a blue 2.
  - Donald knew that Alice's clue was *Finessing* him, since no-one else on the team has any red cards. So, he gasps in surprise when Cathy blind-plays for seemingly no reason.
  - However, Donald knows that he should trust Alice and he should trust Cathy, so he continues to assume that he has the red 2.
  - Donald tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead the blue 3. Donald now knows that this is a *Patch Finesse*.
  - Emily sees the playable red 2 and red 3 in Donald's hand, so she also knows that this was a *Patch Finesse*. The red card in her hand is either red 3 or red 4.
  - We skipped over Bob - why did he discard? Normally, Bob should think the same thing as Cathy - that he has both the red 2 and the red 3. However, Bob can look ahead and see that a *Patch Finesse* could occur, so he has to give precedence to that interpretation and wait to see what will happen. He should try to blind-play the red 2 himself on the next round if no other blind-plays occur.

### The Known Patch Finesse (Illegal)

- Legal *Patch Finesses* are **always hidden**, meaning that from the person who is blind-playing a card to "patch" will **never** know that it is a *Patch Finesse* until **after** they blind-play.
- In other words, if Alice performs a legal *Patch Finesse*, then **no-one else on the team has to even know that the *Patch Finesse* convention exists** - everything will just work out properly because everyone will just blind-play cards like any other ordinary *Layered Finesse*.
  - The exception is when it comes time for the patched player to begin blind-playing. In this situation, the patched player might be "spooked" from the blind-play of the patcher, because they will not understand why the blind-play happened. In this situation, players need to have full trust and not be spooked when another person on the team successfully blind-plays a card in an unexpected way.

### The Double Patch Finesse (Illegal)

- Building on the *Patch Finesse*, it is theoretically possible for a *Patch Finesse* to require **two** separate players to patch at the same time.
- However, we expressly forbid this because it is too confusing. Players should **never** consider the possibility of a *Patch Finesse* with two *Patch Components*.

### The Patch Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

- Theoretically, it could be possible to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* that contains a *Patch Component*.
- However, we explicitly disallow this. *Gentleman's Discards* **must** be for cards that are on slot 1. Otherwise, it would communicate a *Blaze Discard*.

### The Trash Finesse (Weak Form)

- First, see the section on *[Trash Touch Elimination](miscellaneous.md#trash-touch-elimination)*.
- When players deliberately touch ancillary trash and there is only one card "missing", then it should trigger *Trash Touch Elimination Notes*. But what if there are two or more cards that are missing?
- In this situation, the clue giver is promising that someone has one of the missing cards on their *Finesse Position*. Once the card is blind-played, the recipient of the clue will know that one of their ancillary cards are trash.
- This is more subtle than the strong *Trash Finesse*. In the strong form, the focus of the clue causes a blind-play. In the weak form, the non-focused cards are what causes the blind-play
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 3, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  - Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 3. Everyone on the team can see that she can give either 3s or red.
    - If she clues number 3, then it will uniquely touch the red 3 (and not violate *Good Touch Principle*).
    - If she clues red, then it will touch the red 3 and the red 1 (which **will** violate *Good Touch Principle*).
  - Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 3, this is very strange.
  - Bob plays the red 3.
  - There are two "missing" red cards - the red 4 and the red 5. Thus, Cathy knows that Alice must be intending a weak form *Trash Finesse*.
  - Cathy immediately blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is the red 4.
  - Bob sees Cathy blind-play the next red card for seemingly no reason, so he is able to deduce that his slot 2 card is trash.

### The Pestilent Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](level_17.md#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)*.
- In the *Pestilent Double Bluff* example, Cathy is supposed to immediately blind-play her *Finesse Position* card in order to "heal" the situation with Bob.
- However, if Cathy sees that someone else on the team has the red 2 in their *Finesse Position*, then Cathy can see that it is a *Pestilent Finesse* instead of a *Pestilent Bluff*. Cathy can simply let the person with the actual red 2 blind-play and that will "heal" the problem in the exact same way.
- A *Pestilent Finesse* cannot be in reverse. (In other words, the blind-play must happen before the clued player can misplay.)

### The Diseased Clandestine Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](level_17.md#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)*.
- In the *Pestilent Double Bluff* example, Cathy is supposed to immediately blind-play her *Finesse Position* card in order to "heal" the situation with Bob.
- However, if Cathy sees a clue that she can give that will turn the move into a *Clandestine Finesse* on Bob, then she must always do that.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, blue 2, blue 1, blue 5`
  - Donald hand has a red 2 in it.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching a blue 2 on slot 2.
  - Bob blind-plays the red 1.
  - Cathy sees that this looks like a *Pestilent Double Bluff* situation. However, she also sees that if she gives a *Play Clue* to the red 2, Donald will play it, and then Bob will reinterpret Alice's clue as a *Clandestine Finesse*.
  - Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Donald plays the red 2.
  - Alice discards.
  - Originally, Bob thought that Alice had performed a *Self-Finesse* on him for the red 1 into the red 2. However, from *Good Touch Principle*, this cannot be the case anymore, because Cathy got Donald's red 2.
  - Thus, Bob's 2 must be some other 2. Bob knows that this would normally cause a *Pestilent Double Bluff*, but Cathy did not blind-play anything.
  - Thus, this must be a *Disease Clandestine Finesse*. In other words, Alice told him that his 2 was playable right now, and no-one else has blind-played any 1s, so Bob must continue to blind-play cards until his 2 is playable.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the blue 1.
  - Bob knows that his 2 must be the blue 2 to match the blue 1.

### The Surreptitious Finesse

- *Clandestine Finesses* are when a color or rank clue "matches" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver must wait for **additional** matching playable cards to blind-play. Another way of saying this is that *Clandestine Finesses* have a *Misplay Component*; if the blind-player does not continue to blind-play cards, then the clue receiver will go on to misplay the "matching" card.
- A similar situation can also happen when a rank clue "matches" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver sees **non-matching** rank cards in the blind-player's hand that are currently playable.
- If the clue receiver waits for these non-matching cards to blind-play, and they **do** blind-play, then it means that the original clue was on a different suit than it first appeared. This is called a *Surreptitious Self-Finesse* in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary *Clandestine Finesse*.
- *Surreptitious Finesses* have a *Misplay Component* in almost the exact same way that *Clandestine Finesses* do, but they just involve non-matching rank cards.
- Generally speaking, this means that when a **rank** clue initiates a *Finesse*, the clue receiver must always allow for the possibility that subsequent non-matching rank cards in the blind-player's hand (that are of a **lower** rank than the clue) can possibly be caught up in the *Finesse*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches one 3.
  - Bob blind-plays red 2.
  - Cathy knows that red 2 "matches" number 3, so she knows that she probably has red 3.
  - However, Cathy also sees that before Bob blind-played the red 2, he had a blue 1 in the slot right after it.
  - Thus, it is possible for Cathy's 3 to actually be blue 3. If it is, Bob will blind-play the blue 1 and Cathy will know that she has blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*.
  - So, Cathy discards (instead of potentially playing the red 3 on this turn) to allow for the possibility of a *Surreptitious Finesse*.
- Examples of a *Surreptitious Finesse* can be found [here](examples/surreptitious_finesse.md).

### The Distribution Finesse

- On the final round of the game, it is possible to give a *Play Clue* to a player that would be useless - they will not get a chance to play the card before the game ends.
- If a player does this anyway, then it must be communicating something extra. In this situation, it is to be interpreted as a *Finesse* instead of a *Play Clue* for the purposes of better satisfying *Team Distribution Principle*.
- Examples:
  - [Game #16887, turn 29](https://hanab.live/replay/16887/29) if Instantiation clues 5 on the red 5

### Inverted Priority Finesse

- *Priority Finesses* are considered "free", since they do not cost a clue to perform. Thus, it is extremely rare that a player would decline to perform one if it was possible to do so.
- If a player declines to perform a *Priority Finesse*, and there is nothing else special going on, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- They are instead calling for a *Priority Finesse* on the card that had *Priority*. This is called an *Inverted Priority Finesse* because it gets a blind-play from playing a card with *Priority* (as opposed to getting a blind-play from playing a card without *Priority*).
- After a *Inverted Priority Finesse* occurs, the presence of a normal *Priority Finesse* is now known to everyone on the team. Thus, the normal *Priority Finesse* is preserved and should be played into on the next go-around of the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a choice between playing a red 1 and a blue 2. Both cards are fully known, and no-one else has any clued cards, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  - Alice plays the red 1.
  - Bob sees that if Alice had played the blue 2, she could have performed a *Priority Finesse* on Cathy's slot 1 card, the blue 3.
  - Bob knows that there was no reason for Alice to decline the *Priority Finesse*, so this must be an *Inverted Priority Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 2.
  - Cathy knows that the red 1 had *Priority*, so playing it should not have caused Bob to blind-play anything. Thus, Cathy knows that this must be an *Inverted Priority Finesse*, and she knows that she has a blue 3 on her slot 1. Cathy discards.
  - Alice plays blue 2.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays blue 3.
- Note that *Inverted Priority Finesse* **will only work if the players are in a certain order**. Otherwise, the player holding the declined priority card can *Play Clue* the other card, which would destroy the information channel. This means that in most of cases, players should just go with the safer and less complicated option - the normal *Priority Finesse*.

### The Shadow Finesse

- When playing with expert players, it is rare for them to "miss" the chance to *Finesse* a card.
- If an expert player could cleanly *Finesse* a card but instead opts to clue it directly, there must be a good reason.
- If the clue does **not** touch any other new cards, and it is **not** an emergency situation, and it is **not** a mistake, then the player must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, the player giving the clue intends for the next player to blind-play from the *Finesse Position* that **matches the true *Finesse Position*** of the other card. This is called a *Shadow Finesse* because the positional blind-play is a "shadow" of the card that could have been used for the normal *Finesse*.
- The first card to blind-play is called the *shadow* and the second card to blind-play is called the *shadow target*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Donald has a red 2 on his slot 4. Alice could have instead clued red to Donald to *Finesse* Cathy's red 1.
  - Bob sees no other explanation for this, so he knows that this must be a *Shadow Finesse* - Bob must hold the red 2's "shadow".
  - Since the red 2 is in Donald's *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4), Bob immediately plays his *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy can see all of the other hands and understands Alice's clue. Cathy plays the clued red 1.
  - Donald is very surprised to see Bob play his *Fourth Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  - Donald blind-plays the red 2 (the shadow target) from his slot 4.
- The *shadow* in a *Shadow Finesse* **must** exist in the immediate next player's hand, similar to a *Bluff*. And the player holding the *shadow* **must** blind-play it immediately to resynchronize the team, similar to a *Bluff*.
- Once a *shadow* has been blind-played, the team should consider the *shadow target* as being fully known and "touched". (In other words, it no longer occupies a *Finesse Position*.)
- Remember that *Shadow Finesses* work with *Finesse Positions*, **not** with slot numbers.
- Care should be taken to not give a *Shadow Finesse* that could be misinterpreted as some other kind of move. For example:
  - If the *shadow* is on the *First Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *Bluff* or a *Trash Finesse*.
  - If the *shadow* is on the *Second Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *5 Color Ejection*
  - If the *shadow* is on the *Third Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
- The *shadow* **must** come before the *shadow target*. In other words, it is **illegal** for Bob to hold the *shadow target*, since he cannot see that a *Shadow Finesse* is occurring (and therefore might try to get the *shadow*).

### The Reverse Shadow Finesse

- *Shadow Finesses* can also be performed in reverse.
- *Reverse Shadow Finesses* are more complicated than normal *Shadow Finesses*, because the person with the clued card has to look ahead to determine whether or not **they** have the *shadow*, or if a **future** player has the *shadow*.
- For an example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that his red card must be a red 1.
  - Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Alice could have instead clued red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Finesse*.
  - Bob recognizes that Alice must be a *Shadow Finesse*. Bob now must determine where the *shadow* lies.
  - Bob sees that Donald's red 2 is on his *Third Finesse Position*.
  - Bob looks at Cathy's *Third Finesse Position*. If it is playable, then Cathy holds the *shadow*. If it is not playable, then Bob holds the *shadow*.
  - Cathy has a blue 1 in her *Third Finesse Position*, so Bob knows that Cathy holds the *shadow*.
  - Bob plays his clued red 1.
  - Similar to Bob, Cathy also knows that this is a *Shadow Finesse*. Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position*. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald is very surprised to see Cathy blind-play her *Third Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  - Donald blind-plays the *shadow target* from his *Third Finesse Position*.
