These are *Finesses* or *Bluffs* that are triggered by performing a suboptimal clue or by picking a strange choice for a clue.

<br />

### The Suboptimal Save Prompt & The Suboptimal Save Finesse & The Suboptimal Save Bluff

- If the other copy of a card is in the trash already, then the remaining copy needs to be saved. These cards are allowed to be saved with either a color clue or a number clue.
- If both types of clues will **only** introduce one new card, then it is said that that there is a *Free Choice* between the two clue types.
- In this situation, the clue type will be chosen that "fills in" other ancillary cards in the hand or gives important negative information.
- If a clue type is chosen that is **clearly worse** than the other one, then the clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- The means that this innocent-looking *Save Clue* is really a *Play Clue*, and all of the in-between cards are called for.
- Note that for a *Suboptimal Save Finesse* to work, the clue has to be **really bad**, not just technically suboptimal in some slight way.

### The Declined 5's Finesse

- The *5's Chop Move* is typically used to save a 5 and a critical non-5 at the same time. This is very efficient, because it saves both cards with one clue instead of having to spend two clues.
- So, when a player has this strategy available, but instead declines to do it and clues the critical card on chop directly (without touching any other cards), then this is quite strange.
- In this situation, the player must be trying to communicate something extra. Similar to an *Occupied Finesse*, the player is trying to signal that this seemingly innocent *Save Clue* is actually a *Play Clue* instead. Someone on the team must have the cards to make this critical card playable.
- In some situations, the blind-player may have to defer playing into the *Finesse* and instead give a *5 Save* to the player with the (now) unsafe chop. If they do, then this is not a problem - the clue receiver can retroactively determine that a *Declined 5's Finesse* has occurred and should not *stomp* on the *Finesse*.

### The Rank Choice Bluff

- *Reverse Finesses* take precedence over *Bluffs*. This means that players cannot use cards to *Bluff* when there are "matching" cards on other player's *Finesse Positions*.
- However, in some rare situations, when initiating a *Reverse Finesse*, players have a free choice between a color clue and a rank clue, meaning that both rank and color will **only** touch the one target card. Here, players will normally choose color instead of rank, since in most variants, color clues are better than rank clues.
- In this situation, if a player chooses rank instead of color, and there was not a good reason to do so, then the player giving the clue must be trying to communicate something extra - that they really want a *Bluff* to happen (instead of a *Reverse Finesse*). This is called a *Rank Choice Bluff*.
- It is possible to use the *Rank Choice* convention with any kind of *Bluff*. Thus, it is possible to *Rank Choice 3 Bluff*, *Rank Choice Double Bluff*, and so forth.
- Examples:
  - [Game #8129, turn 4](https://hanab.live/replay/8129/4) if Zamiel clues Hyakinthus' green 3 with number 3

### The Rank Choice Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Rank Choice Bluff](#the-rank-choice-bluff)*.
- After Bob sees that Alice wants a *Rank Choice Bluff* to happen, he will blind-play his *Finesse Position* card, expecting it to be an unrelated card. But what if Bob plays a card that matches the card that was clued?
- In this situation, it would be a *Rank Choice Finesse* instead of a *Rank Choice Bluff*. A *Rank Choice Finesse* may be preferable to a (more ordinary) *Ambiguous Finesse*, which will resolve more slowly.

### The Rank Choice Save Finesse

- When saving a card, players have to choose carefully between using a color clue or a rank clue. However, in some rare situations, it makes absolutely no difference which clue is used:
  - Both color and rank would only touch the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would communicate the exact identity of the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would not give any useful negative information to the other cards in the hand.
- In these situations, the player giving the clue has a completely free choice between rank and color. We agree that by default, players should use color to save the card.
- If players instead use a rank clue to save the card, this communicates a *Rank Choice Save Finesse*. (This is similar to the more-ordinary *Rank Choice Finesse*, except it is initiated with a *Save Clue* instead of a *Play Clue*.)
