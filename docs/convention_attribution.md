### General Terms

- The general terms of chop, *Finesse*, and *Bluff* were not invented by this group. Those basic strategies were the building blocks for the current Hyphen-ated framework.
- "Chop" is a term invented by [Ben Smalls](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/smallman), one of the more prominent early Hanabi players. The earliest mention of the word on the Board Game Geek forums comes from [his post back in 2013](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13665606#13665606).
- A "finesse" is a common strategy in [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finesse), so that is the likely origin of the term. The earliest mention of "finesse" and "bluff" on the Board Game Geek forums comes from [Adam Kunsemiller's post in 2012](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/9317490#9317490). He uses the terms in a colloquial way, which implies that these strategies were commonly used at the time of writing.
- The specific inventors of some of our own strategies are listed below.
