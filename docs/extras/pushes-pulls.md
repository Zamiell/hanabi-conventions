### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a *Trash Push* on a *one-away-from-playable* card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a *Prompt* or a *Finesse*.

<br />

### The Trash Pull

- Sometimes, towards the end of the game, there can be a playable card in the middle of someone's hand that is not cluable directly due to the presence of other blocking cards.
- In this situation, players often resort to a *Trash Push* in order to "get" the card without cluing it directly. However, this will only work if the player has a trash card on their chop, which may not always be the case.
- Another tool to "get" a card in the middle of a hand is by doing the opposite of a *Trash Push* - a *Trash Pull*.
- If an off-chop trash card is clued, this would typically be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move*. However, towards the end of the game, a *Chop Move* would be pointless, as there are no cards left to *Chop Move*. Thus, the player should know that it is a *Trash Pull* instead of a *Trash Chop Move*, and should blind-play the card to the right of the trash.
- Just like how a *5 Pull* can only be done in the *Early Game*, a *Trash Pull* can only be done towards the end of the game.
- Since players often perform *Burn* clues for stalling purposes in the *End-Game*, care has to be taken to not confuse a normal *Burn* clue with a *Trash Pull*. This is especially true if there was nothing else obvious for the clue giver to do!
- *Trash Pulls* should typically be used as a last-resort since they might be misinterpreted.

<br />

#### Interaction with Trash Double Ignition

- *Trash Pulls* and *Trash Double Ignition* are initiated in nearly the exact same way, so this can be confusing.
- *Trash Pulls* take precedence over *Trash Double Ignition*. This means that if everyone can see that the *Trash Pull* was necessary to "get" a blocking card, then no-one else on the team is promised to have a playable card. (This follows from *[Occam's Razor](../level-10.md#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)*.)

<br />

### The Playful Ignition

- If a directly playable card is on chop, it's generally very strange to *Chop Move* it if it could just be given a direct *Chop-Focus Play Clue*. This is because doing so can be extremely bad for tempo and can cause issues with *Clue Focus* in the future.
- However, what if a player performs a *Chop Move* on a playable card while there seems to be no good reason to do so? They must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they are really trying to perform a *Playful Ignition*, which *Ignites* a card from the next player. The next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, which gives the player with the *Chop Moved* card enough information to know that it is actually playable.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  - It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that since there were other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, Cathy will interpret this as an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  - Bob also knows that it is nonsensical to *Chop Move* a playable red 1 - Alice could have just give a red *Chop-Focus Play Clue* to the red 1.
  - Thus, this must be a *Playful Ignition*, so Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Playful Ignition*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

- Sometimes, it can be useful to *Chop Move* a playable card. Something is only a *Playful Ignition* if there is not some other good reason for the *Chop Move*. Specifically, the player might want to:
  - Avoid violating *Good Touch Principle*.
  - Save a *Delayed Playable* card that is followed by a critical card.
  - Save two important cards when there are a lot of cards to deal with and the team is low on clues.
  - Get a blind-play from *Elimination* when the duplicate is visible.
- More examples of a *Playful Ignition* can be found [here](../examples/5-double-pull.md).

#### Interaction with 5 Rank Clues

- This interaction is turned **off** in *Late-Game*
- When playing with both *Bad Chop Move Ejections* and *Playful Ignitions*, **every** rank clue that newly touches a 5 that is one away from chop should be considered a *Chop Move*.
- In other words, a *5's Chop Move* interpretation **always** takes precedence over a *Direct Play Clue* on the focused 5.
- Therefore, players must remember that regardless of any resulting blind-play, the focused 5 could still be any color. Instead, such a blind-play **always** relates to the card being *Chop Moved* by the clue, not the 5 directly.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is no longer *Early Game*, and blue 3 and green 2 are on the stack.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: green 2, yellow 3, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues 5 to Cathy, touching a green 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob sees this is a *Playful Ignition*, and therefore blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 4 and it successfully plays.
  - It is now Cathy's turn. Even though a blue 4 was just blind-played, Cathy knows that this does not indicate that her 5 is necessarily blue; it could still be any color. Since Alice's clue was by definition a *5's Chop Move*, Cathy knows that this must mean Bob was reacting to the *Chop Move*.
  - Cathy understands that Bob must have blind-played as a *Playful Ignition*. She blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

- Inversely, even if a directly playable 5 is given a rank clue while one away from chop, the next player may still be expected to respond as a *Bad Chop Move Ejection* or *Playful Ignition* if the resulting *Chop Move* would be abnormal.
