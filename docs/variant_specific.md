### Hard Variants & Easy Variants

- Some variants demand an enormous amount of efficiency. Since our normal conventions result in conservative play, we agree to change the way that we play in some specific variants in order to win more consistently.
- We define any variant that requires equal to or greater than 1.25 efficiency as a "hard" variant. (Required efficiency can be seen in-game using the Hanab Live interface. Note that a variant can be considered easy in 4-player, but hard in 5-player, for example.)
- Additionally, the following variants are considered to be hard variants even though they may have less than 1.25 required efficiency:
  - Any variant with a null suit
  - Any "Mix" variant
  - Color Mute
  - Number Mute
  - Throw It in a Hole
  - Cow & Pig
  - Duck
- In hard variants, the following changes are made to the conventions:
  - Players are not allowed to *Double Discard Avoid*. Any clue given in a *Double Discard* situation will instead be treated like a clue given in a non-*Double Discard* situation.
  - Players are not allowed to *5 Stall* in the *Early Game*. Any clue that looks like a *5 Stall* is instead treated as either a *5's Chop Move* or a *5 Pull*.
  - Players are not required to clue anything in the *Early Game*; they are allowed to initiate the *Mid-Game* whenever they see fit.

### Loaded Play Clues in Hard Variants (Part 1)

- Normally, players are allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a card on chop, even if that clued player:
  - has one or more playable cards to play (e.g. they won't discard their chop because they will almost certainly play their playable card)
  - has one or more known-trash cards to discard (e.g. they won't discard their chop because they will almost certainly discard their known-trash card instead)
- If a *Save Clue* is given in this kind of situation, it is referred to as an *Early Save*. In our group, *Early Saves* are normal, and they don't cause anything special to happen. (Allowing *Early Saves* is nice because it allows for *Discard Modulation.*)
- In *Hard* variants (see the previous section), *Early Saves* are not legal. Instead, if an *Early Save* is given to a player, then it is treated as a *Play Clue* on that card.
- This is called a *Loaded Play Clue* to distinguish it from a more ordinary *Play Clue*, because the player receiving the clue is currently "loaded" with a play or "loaded" with a safe discard.
- *Loaded Play Clues* **do not** apply in the *Early Game* - they are only "turned on" in the *Mid-Game*.
- *Loaded Play Clues* **do not** apply in *Double Discard* situations. (Even though *Double Discard Avoidance* is "turned off" in hard variants in general, players are still allowed to avoid *Double Discarding* by giving *Early Saves* to cards.)

### Loaded Play Clues in Hard Variants (Part 2)

- *Loaded Play Clues* also apply to the *5's Chop Move*. This means that any clue that looks like a *5's Chop Move* will instead look like a *Loaded Play Clue* (if the clue receiver is currently "loaded" with a play).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a known red 4 in his hand on slot 5.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob knows that in a normal game, since the 5 was one-away from chop, Alice's clue would be a *5's Chop Move*.
  - Bob also knows that in hard variants, the *5's Chop Move* convention is turned off when the player receiving the clue is "loaded' with a play. Thus, this must be a *Loaded Play Clue* on the 5.
  - Bob plays the red 4 and will play the 5 on the next turn as red 5.
- Note that this section does not apply in the *Early Game*, because *Loaded Play Clues* are turned off in the *Early Game*. Any number 5 clue given to a *one-away-from-chop* 5 in the *Early Game* is to be treated as a *5's Chop Move*.

### Precedence of Variant-Specific Conventions

- We have many variant-specific strategies and conventions. Sometimes, it can be confusing as to how they interact with "normal" conventions (e.g. non-variant-specific conventions).
- In general, non-variant-specific conventions take precedence over variant-specific conventions, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

### 2-Player

- In the *Hyphen-ated Group*, we generally only play games with 3 to 5 players. If you are interested in playing 2-player games, then see the [2-player page](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md).

### Empty Clues

- *Empty Clues* are clues that touch no cards in a hand. On Hanab Live, each game has the option to allow *Empty Clues*. In our group, we typically disallow this option since it makes the game too easy.
- If *Empty Clues* are enabled, it allows for a much wider channel of information transfer. We have developed an entire convention framework around this channel and it is too complicated to cover in a single section here.
- If you are interested in learning about in the extended *Empty Clue* conventions, they are documented [on a separate page](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Empty_Clues.md).
