- A *Discharge* refers to a *Signal Shift* blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Third Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Third Finesse Position* is slot 3.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge

- The *Unknown Trash Discharge* is introduced in [level 15](level15.md).
- This results in a *Signal Shift* from *Play* --> *Trash*.

### 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

- The *5 Number Discharge* is introduced in [level 15](level15.md).
- This results in a *Signal Shift* from *Play* --> *Trash* (on the *5 Pulled* card).

### Trash Push Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is on chop, it communicates a *Trash Push*.
- However, what if the *Trash Pushed* card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Discharge* on the very next player.
- This move is extremely similar to the *Unknown Trash Discharge*. In UTD, the focus of the clue is promised as trash. In the *Trash Push Discharge*, the *Trash Pushed* card is promised as trash.
