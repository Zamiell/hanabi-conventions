- A *Charm* refers to a *Signal Shift* blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Fourth Finesse Position*. For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Fourth Finesse Position* is slot 4.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Charm* can only be performed on the very next player.

### 4 Charm

- When a *Play Clue* is given to a 4 that is not yet playable, Bob must react:
  - The first interpretation is that it is a *Prompt*.
  - If Bob has no matching cards in his hand, then a *Prompt* is impossible.
  - The second interpretation is that it is a *Finesse*.
  - If Bob sees that he would have to **blind-play one card** or **blind-play two cards** to fulfill a *Finesse*, then he should assume that it is a *Finesse*.
  - If Bob sees that he would have to **blind-play three cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely.
  - The third interpretation is that it is a *4 Double Bluff*.
  - If Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card (or a *one-away-from-playable* card) on her *Finesse Position*, then a *4 Double Bluff* is impossible.
  - The fourth interpretation is a *4 Charm*; Bob should play his *Fourth Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 clue to Cathy, touching a red 4 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *Finesse* on the red 4, meaning that he should blind-play a red 1, a red 2, and a red 3. (Bob does not see any red cards in anyone else's hands.)
  - Since the *Finesse* requires three blind-plays, it is unlikely, and Bob knows he is supposed to revert to a different interpretation.
  - Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card (or a *one-away-from-playable* card) on her *Finesse Position*, so a *4 Double Bluff* is impossible.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *4 Charm*. He blind-plays his *Fourth Finesse Position*. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- *4 Charms* can be given with either a color clue or a number clue.
- Similar to a *5 Color Ejection*, *Prompts* don't factor into the "three or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
- *4 Charms* take precedence over *Safety Charms*.

### The Safety Charm (Declined 5 Pull)

- This convention only applies in the *Low Score Phase*.
- If a card could be freely gotten by initiating a *5 Pull*, it would be very strange if the *5 Pull* was declined and the card was directly touched as a 1-for-1.
- When this occurs, this player is trying to communicate something deeper - a *Charm* on the very next player.
- Normally, when a card is blind-played after an innocent-looking *Play Clue*, the clue receiver knows to not play that card anymore. In this situation, since the *Fourth Finesse Position* card was played instead of the *First*, *Second*, or *Third*, the clue receiver will know that their card is still playable **and** that the unclued card directly to its left must be a 5.
- This untouched 5 is now globally known; everyone on the team should treat it as a *Chop Moved* card.
- This can be understood as a full-circle *Signal Shift*, from *Play* --> *Play*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - It is the *Early Game* and the *Low Score Phase*.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a new red 2 on slot 2.
  - Cathy hand is, from newest to oldest: `blue 5, red 2, blue 3, blue 2`
  - Bob sees that Alice could have cleanly *5 Pulled* Cathy's red 2. (It is globally known that Alice had another *Play Clue* to give, so a number 5 clue would not have been interpreted as a *5 Stall*.)
  - Bob knows that this signals a blind-play:
    - A *First Finesse Position* blind-play would look like a *Bluff* on a red 3, which would be a *Lie*.
    - A *Second Finesse Position* blind-play would look like a *5 Color Ejection* on a red 5, which would be a *Lie*.
    - A *Third Finesse Position* blind-play would look like an *Unknown Trash Discharge* on a red 1, which would be a *Lie*.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Safety Charm*. He blind-plays his *Fourth Finesse Position*. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that she must have the red 2. She also knows that her slot 1 card is a 5 that could have been used for a *5 Pull*. Cathy marks the 5 as being *Chop Moved* for later.
- *4 Charms* take precedence over *Safety Charms*.
