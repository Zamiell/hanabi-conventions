## Conventions & Special Moves

### Ejection

- *Ejection* refers to a move like a *Bluff*, but instead of playing an unrelated card from *Finesse Position*, someone plays an unrelated card from their *Second Finesse Position*. For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Second Finesse Position* is slot 2.
- Just like a *Bluff*, an *Ejection* can only be performed on the very next player.
- Several different kinds of moves can cause an *Ejection*. The most common one is called the *5 Color Ejection*.

### The 5 Color Ejection (5CE)

- Normally, if a player gives a color *Play Clue* to a 5, it would mean that it is a *Finesse* on the 5 and all of the cards leading up to the 5 are playable.
- If the very next player sees that they will only have to **blind-play one card** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse* and blind-play their *Finesse Position*.
- If the very next player sees that they would have to **blind-play two or more cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Ejection* and that the next player should play their *Second Finesse Position*.
  - *Prompts* don't factor into the "two or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
- After the blind-play, the player who received the clue will know that they must have a 5.
- Note that *5 Color Ejection* only applies if the 5 did not have any clues on it already. If a 5 is re-clued, it signals a *Finesse* on all of the cards leading up to the 5.
  - However, the "invisible" clue from a *Chop Move* does not count. In other words, you **can** perform a *5 Color Ejection* with a *Chop Moved* 5, as long as the card does not have any positive clues on it.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a *Finesse* on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 2, the red 3, and the red 4. However, since this calls for more than one blind card, he knows that *5 Color Ejection* should take precedence, so he knows to play his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, if Bob had played his *Finesse Position* card in response to the red clue, then Cathy would know that it was a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. But since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, it must be a *5 Color Ejection*. Cathy marks the red card as red 5.
- In the previous example, a *5 Color Ejection* was preformed with the 5 being the only brand new card introduced with the color clue. However, it is also possible to perform a *5 Color Ejection* with more than one card introduced. Normally, this kind of thing would signal an *Out-of-Order Finesse*, but the *5 Color Ejection* interpretation should take precedence as long as the next player would have to blind-play two or more cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 2 and a red 2 on slot 3.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Out-of-Order Finesse* on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 3, and the red 4. However, since this calls for more than one blind card, he knows that *5 Color Ejection* should take precedence, so he knows to play his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, if Bob had played his *Finesse Position* card in response to the red clue, then Cathy would know that it was a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. But since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, it must be a *5 Color Ejection*. Cathy marks the red card as red 5. Her other red card can be red 2, red 3, or red 4.

## General Principles

### Assuming Asymmetric Information

* Sometimes, players will figure out asymmetric information about the identities of cards in their hand.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the *Early Game* and there are 3 clues available.
  * Alice discards, initiating the *Mid-Game*.
  * Bob knows that there must be nothing left to clue, or Alice would have been obligated to clue it.
  * Bob has three 2's in his hand that were saved with a *2 Save* clue earlier on.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on chop. Since Alice did not clue it, Bob must have the other copy in his hand.
  * Bob has not discarded since the *2 Save* was given to him earlier on. Thus, he knows that one of his three clued 2's must be the other copy of the red 2, so he marks all three cards as "possible red 2".
  * However, these notes are asymmetric - Alice and Bob write the notes, but Cathy does not. (Cathy has no idea that this is happening because Cathy cannot see her own red 2 on chop.)
  * Alice and Bob will have to keep this information desync in mind going forward.
* By default, players should never assume that other players have asymmetric information. This is because having asymmetric information is the **exception**, rather than the norm.
* In the previous example, Bob might perform an action later on in the game that seems to demonstrate that he knows he has the red 2. But Cathy should not assume that he does, unless there is **no other explanation** for the clue.
