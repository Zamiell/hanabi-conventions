## Examples of the [Safety Charm](../Reference.md#the-safety-charm-declined-5-pull)

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/safety_charm.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and Alice starts.
- Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a blue 1 on slot 2.
- The next player is Bob. Bob can see that this is a *Declined 5 Pull*. (Due to the presence of the red 1 in Donald's hand, Cathy would not interpret a number 5 clue from Alice as a *5 Stall*.) Thus, Bob knows that Alice is intending a *Safety Charm*.
- Bob blind-plays his *Forth Finesse Position* card. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy knows that the only explanation for Bob playing his *Forth Finesse Position* card is that a *Safety Charm* occurred. Thus, Cathy marks her slot 1 card as a 5.
