## Examples of the [5 Number Discharge](../Reference.md#5-number-discharge-5nd)

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/5_number_discharge.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and Jake_Stiles starts.
- Jake_Stiles clues number 5 to IAMJEFF. That touches the red 5.
- The next player is Libster. Libster can see that this is not a *5 Stall*, since there are many different *Play Clues* to give. That means that normally, this would be a *5 Pull*.
- However, Libster can also see that the *5 Pulled* card is the blue 4, which is three-away-from-playable, so that does not make much sense. Libster knows that when a *5 Pull* is performed on a card that is two-or-more-away-from-playable, it is instead a *5 Number Discharge*.
- Libster blind-plays his *Third Finesse Position*. It is green 1 and it successfully plays.
