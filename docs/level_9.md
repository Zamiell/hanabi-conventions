## Conventions & Special Moves

### Duplication Responsibility

- Usually, if a 2 needs to be saved, it is not the responsibility of a player with already-clued 2's in his hand, because they could potentially violate *Good Touch Principle* by cluing it. So, they should defer and let someone else on the team do it. (The same general concept also applies to cluing playable cards on chop, for example.)
- However, if all players have a clued 2 in their hand, then someone has to take a risk of violating *Good Touch Principle* in order to satisfy *Save Principle*. Who should do it?
- In this situation, the player who has the least number of matching clued cards should take responsibility. If 2+ players are tied, then the player with the less specific type of clue on their card(s) should take responsibility.
- If 2+ players have the exact same number of clued cards and type of clued cards, then either player should save the card.
- Example 1:
  - In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  - Bob has 2 unknown 2's.
  - Cathy has 1 unknown 2.
  - Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.
- Example 2:
  - In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  - Bob has 2 unknown 2's.
  - Cathy has 2 unknown 2's.
  - The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.
- Example 3:
  - In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  - Bob has 2 unknown blue cards.
  - Cathy has 1 unknown 2's.
  - Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.
- Example 4:
  - In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  - Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob's perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  - Cathy has 2 unknown 2's. No 2's have been played yet, so from Cathy's perspective, each 2 has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  - The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.
- Example 5:
  - In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  - Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob's perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  - Cathy has 2 unknown 2's. One 2 has been played already, so from Cathy's perspective, each 2 has a 1/4 chance of being the blue 2.
  - Thus, it is Bob's responsibility to save the blue 2.

### The Ambiguous Finesse

- Sometimes, the player that is supposed to blind-play a card into a *Finesse* is ambiguous. For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald about a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Both Bob **and** Cathy have red 1 on their *Finesse Position*.
  - Bob will think that it is a *Finesse* directed at Cathy, and he will discard.
  - Next, Cathy thinks that Bob made a mistake and "missed" the *Finesse*. Cathy discards.
- Here, Cathy is actually the one making the mistake. It follows from *High-Value Principle* that you should never assume that your teammates are making a mistake. If Bob is discarding, then it means that Cathy also has the exact same copy of the card, and Cathy should immediately blind-play.

### The Ambiguous Finesse Pass-Back

- When an *Ambiguous Finesse* occurs, the first player will not play into the *Finesse*, and do something unrelated. At that point, it is usually clear that **another player** on the team **also** has the matching card. That other player should then **immediately blind-play**, resolving the *Ambiguous Finesse* as fast as possible.
- However, in some specific situations, the second person **cannot** blind-play the card, or else a misplay would occur. In these situations, the second person has to **also** not play into the *Finesse*. This "passes" the blind-play back to the first person again.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Blue 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*. From his position, this must be a *Double Finesse*, with Cathy blind-playing the blue 2, and Bob blind-playing the blue 3 from his own *Finesse Position*. Bob discards.
  - Cathy sees that Bob has the blue 2 on his *Finesse Position* and the blue 3 on his *Second Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy also knows that the only reason that Bob would discard is if Cathy **also** had the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Bob expects her to blind-play on this turn, and this is an *Ambiguous Finesse*.
  - Normally, Cathy would blind-play the blue 2 herself. However, in this situation, if she blind-plays the blue 2, then Bob would go on to misplay the other blue 2, thinking that it is blue 3.
  - Thus, Cathy must pretend like the *Finesse* is not on her after all, and force Bob to be the one to blind-play first. Cathy discards her chop card, passing the *Finesse* back to Bob.
  - Donald and Alice discard.
  - Bob knows that Cathy was supposed to blind-play the blue 2, but she didn't. He must also have the blue 2. Furthermore, he must also have the blue 3, as that would be an excellent reason for Cathy to pass the *Finesse* back to him. Bob will now blind-play blue 2 and blue 3.
- As a side note, you may be wondering why, in the above example, Cathy does not blind-discard her blue 2 from her *Finesse Position* instead of discarding her chop. This is because it is possible that Cathy does **not** have the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position* and instead has some other unrelated playable card as a *Layered Finesse*. Thus, Cathy must play it safe and discard her chop. (The *[Layered Finesse](#the-layered-finesse)* is a move covered in Level 4.)

### The Trash Order Chop Move

- Sometimes, a player will have two known trash cards in their hand (and these cards are explicitly known trash, meaning that everyone on the team can equally see that they are known trash).
- In this situation, the player is expected to discard the newest (left-most) trash card.
- Thus, if a player skips over their newest trash card and instead discards the second newest trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should *Chop Move* (in a manner similar to a *Order Chop Move*).
- Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a *Trash Order Chop Move* if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player "sees" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.

### The 3 Bluff

- Typically, the player who receives a clue that causes a *Bluff* blind-play knows that the card that was clued is one-away from being playable.
- Our group plays with an artificial *3 Bluffs* convention. This means that in addition to being one-away from being playable, we agree that the touched card can *also* be any 3 that will be useful in the future.
- *3 Bluffs* are mostly used to get 1's played at the beginning of the game. However, similar to a normal *Bluff*, a *3 Bluff* can be used to get any playable card (as long as it doesn't look like a *Finesse*, obviously.)
- Here are some examples that cover the four most common *3 Bluff* situations:

#### Example 1 - **Color Mismatch** (Valid)

- On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
- Bob blind-plays blue 1.
- Cathy knows that it is either a red 2 (if it was a normal *Bluff*) or a red 3 (if it was a *3 Bluff*). She marks down both of the possibilities for later.

#### Example 2 - **Number 3 with Suit Mismatch** (Valid)

- On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.
- Bob blind-plays blue 1.
- Cathy knows that it was a *3 Bluff*, because a played 1 does not "match" number 3.
- Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it).

#### Example 3 - **Color Match** (NOT valid; looks like a Finesse)

- On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
- Bob blind-plays red 1.
- Cathy sees that Bob does not have red 2. Since red matches red, Cathy assumes that she has the red 2.
- Cathy misplays red 3 as red 2.
- Alternatively, if Cathy saw that Bob had both red 1 and red 2 on his *Finesse Position* at the time the clue was given, she would know that she has the red 2 **or** the red 3. Subsequently, Bob is promised a red 2, since if he does not blind-play a card, Cathy will go on to misplay the red 3 as red 2.

#### Example 4 - **Color Match with Rank Mismatch** (NOT valid; looks like a Finesse):
  - This is a 4-player game.
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, touching a red 3 as a play clue.
  - Bob blind-plays the red 1.
  - Cathy notices that Donald's red card has a negative 2 clue on it. This means that Donald will not go on to misplay the card as the red 2.
  - Cathy needs to evaluate whether or not Alice's clue is a *Finesse* or a *3 Bluff*. If this is a *Double Finesse*, then Cathy needs to blind-play the red 2. If this is a *Bluff*, then Alice only intended for Bob to blind-play.
  - Cathy knows that since **red matches red**, this must be a *Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays the red 2 into the red 3.

#### Example 5 - **Number 3 with Suit Match** (valid)

- On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.
- Bob blind-plays red 1.
- Cathy knows that it was a *3 Bluff*, because a played 1 does not "match" number 3.
- Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it).
- Even though red 1 and red 3 are the same suit, Bob is not promised a red 2, because if he does nothing, Cathy will not go on to misplay the red 3.

#### Generic Questions

- *3 Bluffs* can be confusing. If you don't want to memorize the five examples above, you can simply ask the following questions:
  1) Does the clue "match" the blind-play? If it matches, then it is a *Finesse*. If it does not match, then it is a *Bluff*. Red matches red, but red does **not** match blue. 2 matches 3, but 1 does **not** match 3.
  2) Will the player who received the clue go on to misplay if nothing else is blind-played? If yes, then it is a *Finesse*. If no, then it is a *Bluff*.

### The Critical 4 Bluff

- Building on the *3 Bluffs* convention, we also agree that it is possible for a card that initiates a *Bluff* to be a copy of any of the 4s that are currently in the discard pile, but only if **a color clue** is used.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks. Red 4 is currently in the discard pile.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a blue 1.
  - Cathy marks her red card as the *one-away-from-playable* red card, the red 2.
  - However, Cathy also knows that *3 Bluffs* are a thing, so she *also* marks her red card as possibly a red 3.
  - However, Cathy also knows that *Critical 4 Bluffs* are a thing, so she *also* marks her red card as possibly a red 4.

### Context Clues & The Stale 1's Clue

- We have many conventions that specify what a clue means. But combined with this, we are always expected to look at the context of the game.
- For example, sometimes players will receive a clue that just feels strange. If this good clue could have been given a bunch of turns ago, why is it only being given now? Were the other players not paying close enough attention, and are only getting around to cluing this card now?
- In these types of situations, from *High Value Principle*, you can assume that the team is not making any mistakes, which means that the meaning of the clue should be altered from the "textbook" definition. We call these types of clues *Context Clues* because they rely on contextual reading of the game state.
- The most common *Context Clue* is given to "stale" 1's towards the beginning of the game. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - After a few ordinary clues happen, Alice discards, which ends the *Early Game* and initiates the *Mid-Game*. By doing this, she implies that there is nothing to do (because players are mandated to "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* in the *Early Game*).
  - Bob then immediately clues Cathy about two 1's.
  - Normally, from *Good Touch Principle*, Cathy would assume that both of the 1's were "good" and play both.
  - However, Cathy also knows that if both of these 1's were good, then Alice was required to clue them before discarding.
  - Thus, Cathy can reason that one of the 1's are bad. Furthermore, by convention, she knows that the oldest (right-most) 1 is bad, because that would be the one that she would ordinarily play first.
  - So, Cathy should skip over the oldest (right-most) 1, and play the other 1. Cathy should also treat the other 1 as known-trash.
- The *Stale 1's Clue* is specific example of a more general concept called *Focus Inversion*, which is covered later.

### Focus Inversion

- Sometimes, a *Play Clue* is given that both touches the chop card and one or more other card. The normal interpretation of this is to treat it as a chop-focus *Play Clue*, and play the chop. However, sometimes a player can know that the chop is not actually playable. This can be determined through:
  - explicit information - negative clues present on the card
  - implicit information - historical / contextual information about the card derived from moves that teammates performed earlier on in the game
- When this occurs, the clue is meant to be a *Play Clue* on the left-most card **instead** of the chop card.
- Just like a "normal" *Play Clue* that touches multiple new cards, the chop card (and other new cards introduced) are not necessarily playable right now.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which introduces one card on slot 1.
  - Bob plays the 1 and it is red 1.
  - Cathy clues blue to Bob, which introduces two cards on slot 1 and slot 5.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Chop-Focus* clue, and play the blue 1 from slot 5.
  - However, his slot 5 card has a negative 1 clue on it (from Alice's number 1 clue), so it explicitly cannot be the blue 1.
  - Thus, this must be *Focus Inversion* and blue 1 must be on slot 1. The blue card on slot 5 can be either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5.
- Note that ***Self-Finesses* with rank always take precedence over *Focus Inversion***. (*Self-Finesses* with rank are quite common, but *Self Finesses* with color are nonsensical.)

### The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)

- Near the end of the game, if you have no clues left and no cards to play, you can transmit information based on which card you discard.
- Thus, you can discard the slot in your hand that matches the slot in someone else's hand that they are supposed to play.
- Usually, players will only do this if they can see all of the remaining useful cards. Since they see everything, they know that they cannot be discarding anything important.

### The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)

- On the final round of the game, if a player has no cards in their hand to play, a *Positional Discard* from **any** slot will work, because it is globally known that every card is visible.
- However, sometimes *Positional Discards* are done before the final round while there are still some cards left in the deck. In this situation, if a player discarded their chop card as a *Positional Discard*, this would not work, because discarding chop is the normal action that the rest of the team is expecting.
- Thus, in order to more strongly communicate the "play this slot" message, they can instead misplay their chop card. Since the rest of the team can see that the card misplayed for "no reason", they can deduce that it was a *Positional Misplay*.

### The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)

- Normally, the *Positional Misplay* is only used as a last-resort when a *Positional Discard* would not work. But what if a player does a *Positional Misplay* when a normal *Positional Discard* would have gotten the job done?
- *Positional Discards* and *Positional Misplays* promise that only one card in the specified slot is playable. So, if there are **two** people with a play on the same slot, then it will be ambiguous, because each of them will think that the other person is supposed to play.
- Thus, a *Positional Misplay* that is unnecessary transforms into a *Double Positional Misplay*, indicating to the team that **two** cards on that exact slot are playable.

## General Principles

### Legal Bluff Targets

- The full list of "legal *Bluff* targets" is as follows:
  - any *one-away-from-playable* card (with either a color clue or a number clue)
  - any 3 (with either a color clue or a number clue)
  - any critical 4 (only with a color clue)

### Cluing 1's in the Early Game

- As outlined in the [level 2 strategy section](#tempo), Hanabi is about balancing between *Efficiency* and *Tempo*.
- As outlined in the [level 5 strategy section](#the-value-of-one-away-from-playable-cards), *one-away-from-playable* cards are valuable.
- So, players have to balance *Efficiency*, *Tempo*, and "locking in" a touch on *one-away-from-playable* cards.
- In the *Early Game*, it is very common for players to give a number 1 clue when they see a hand that has two or more 1's in it. And this type of clue is normally pretty good. But because of the previous considerations, sometimes it would be better to get the 1's with several color clues instead.

#### Example 1

- Players should not just consider how good their individual clue is - they should also consider how their teammates can **build** on top of their clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `green 4, red 1, red 3, blue 2, blue 1`
  - Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played from Bob's hand. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should Alice clue number 1, red, or blue?
  - If Alice clues number 1, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will probably spend a clue getting the blue 2. This will result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. And the red 3 will probably end up being discarded. Bad.
  - If Alice clues blue, it would be a 2-for-1 clue. But then the team will no longer be able to give a red clue, because it would be *Chop-Focused* on the red 3. So they would have to clue number 1, which would result in an efficiency of 3-for-2. Bad.
  - Thus, Alice should clue red first, and then clue blue later, resulting in an efficiency of 4-for-2.

#### Example 2

- When players make the choice between cluing number 1 or cluing color, the cards in other people's hands should also be considered.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, green 4, blue 3, blue 1`
  - Donald is holding a cluable red 2.
  - Alice would like to get the red 1 and the blue 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 or a blue 1.) Should she clue 1, red, or blue?
  - Just like in the previous example, cluing number 1 means that the red 2 will have to be clued as a 1-for-1, which results in an efficiency of 3-for-2.
  - Instead, Alice clues red to Donald, performing the *Finesse* as a 2-for-1. Next, Bob clues blues to Cathy as a 2-for-1. In total, this is a 4-for-2.

#### Example 3

- As explained in the [beginner's guide](beginner.md#other-general-strategy), it is almost always better to give a *Play Clue* instead of a *Save Clue* if a player has a playable card in their hand.
- However, building on the theme of having teammates "build" on your clues, sometimes it is better to give a *Save Clue* first and then a *Play Clue* later.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `blue 4, blue 4, red 3, red 1, blue 5`
  - Alice would like to get the red 1 played. (No-one else has a red 1 in their hand.) Alice also knows that the team needs to eventually save the red 5.
  - If Alice clues number 1 first to get the red 1, then the team will need to give a *5 Save* to save the blue 5, resulting in an efficiency of 2-for-2.
  - Instead, Alice clues number 5 as a *5 Save*, which allows Bob to follow up with a red *Chop-Focus Play Clue*. This touches the red 3 as a 2-for-1, allowing for an overall efficiency of a 3-for-2.

#### Other Considerations

- Just in case you thought Hanabi was not difficult enough, there are some other factors to consider when finding the best clue:
  - Does giving a color clue put a playable card on *Finesse Position*? If so, maybe a color clue is better.
  - Does giving a number 1 clue give the player the ability to perform a useful *Order Chop Move*? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.
  - Are there other ways to touch the extra cards from a color clue? If so, maybe a number 1 clue is better.
