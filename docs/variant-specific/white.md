These conventions apply to any variant with a white (touched by no colors) suit.

<br />

### White Direct Play Clue Assumption
- Players are not allowed to give *Early Saves* with rank clues when the white card of that rank is playable.
- Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that this convention does apply in the *Early Game*.
- This means that if a player is *Loaded*, and a *Chop-Focused* card could be a playable white card, then they will assume it is a *Play Clue*.
    - Note that it could still be a *Play Clue* on a card that isn't white.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
    - White 2 is played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
    - Bob has a globally-known playable red 1 in his hand.
    - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
    - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the blue 3.
    - However, Bob knows that white 3 is currently playable and that he is Loaded. Thus, this must be a *Play Clue* on a white 3.
- As an exception, *White Direct Play Clue Assumption* does not apply to number 5 clues in the *Low Score Phase*.

### No Early Saves on White Cards
- Players are not allowed to give *Early Saves* on white cards.
- This means that if a player is *Loaded*, and a *Chop-Focused* clue is given to an unplayable white card, the team will treat it as a *Finesse*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a globally-known playable red 1 in her hand.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a white 2 on her chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the white 2.
  - However, Bob knows that *Early Saves* are not allowed on white cards. Thus, this must a *Finesse* for white 1.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 1 and it is the white 1.
- This convention always applies, even in the *Early Game*.
