# Specific Conventions for Dark Pink

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark pink (touched by all ranks and one of each) suit.

<br />

### Black Conventions & Pink Conventions

- Dark Pink "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

### Save Clues

- Just like a black suit, dark pink 3 and dark pink 4 are saved with a pink color clue.

### Dark Pink Tempo Clues

- Normally, *Tempo Clues* on pink cards would never cause a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* (because *Tempo* on pink cards is important).
- However, this does not apply to dark pink cards. *Tempo Clues* on dark pink cards work as they normally do. (Meaning that it is possible to perform a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* by giving a *Tempo Clue* to a dark pink card, provided that all of the other normal *Tempo Clue Chop Move* conditions are met.)
