These conventions apply to any variant with a dark pink (touched by all ranks and one of each) suit.

### Black Conventions & Pink Conventions

- Dark Pink "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

### Save Clues

- Just like a black suit, dark pink 3 and dark pink 4 are saved with a pink color clue.

### Dark Pink Tempo Clues

- Normally, *Tempo Clues* on pink cards would never cause a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* (because *Tempo* on pink cards is important).
- However, this does not apply to dark pink cards. *Tempo Clues* on dark pink cards work as they normally do. (Meaning that it is possible to perform a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* by giving a *Tempo Clue* to a dark pink card, provided that all of the other normal *Tempo Clue Chop Move* conditions are met.)

### Fake 5's Chop Move

- Players are allowed to violate _Pink Promise_ on dark pink cards in order to perform a _Fake 5's Chop Move_.
- This means that _Pink Promise_ no longer applies to off-chop cards when they are clued as a 5, unless it was just a _5 Stall_.

### Fake 5 Pull

- Similar to the [Fake 5's Chop Move](#fake-5s-chop-move), players can also violate _Pink Promise_ in order to initiate a _5 Pull_.
- Since this sort of clue is illegal as just a _5 Stall_, this promises the team that a _5 Pull_ (or, therefore, a _5ND_) is occurring.
