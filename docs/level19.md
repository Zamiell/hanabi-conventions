- Level 19 strategies are separated from the rest because they do not come up that often. Thus, non-expert players do not have to worry about learning them.
- If a level 19 strategy does come up in a game, players with experience can often figure out what to do on-the-fly. Even if they don't, they can quickly learn about them in the post-game review, and then use the document as a reference later on in case they need to refresh their memory.
