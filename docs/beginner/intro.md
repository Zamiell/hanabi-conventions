# The Beginner's Guide

## About this guide

- Are you looking to start playing Hanabi with the *Hyphen-ated Group*? Fantastic - we are always looking to welcome new players. Take 30 minutes and go through this guide so that you can get up to speed with the basics.
- Alternatively, are you looking to learn some solid fundamental strategies to use to play Hanabi with your own group of friends? Feel free to adopt these strategies.
- Is a 30 minute briefing really necessary? Well, yes and no. If you try to play with our group and don't understand what basic clues mean, it is going to be analogous to a group of people trying to find each other in a dark room by running around with their arms flailing.
- We know that 30 minutes might be too long for some people to sit through. So, we've tried to split up the guide into bite-sized chunks with fun challenge questions at the end of every section in order to keep you interested.
- Note that the beginner's guide assumes that you are already familiar with the basic rules of Hanabi. If you need to brush up on them, either [read them here](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/RULES.md) or [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrFCekQb4nY).
- If you know the rules but you've *never actually played* Hanabi, then it might be best to play a practice game or two before reading the guide so that you are more familiar with the game mechanics.

## Overview

The length of the guide might be intimidating at first. But, everything written can be summarized in a few principles:

- When players discard, they should discard their oldest unclued card (called the *Chop*).
- In the Hyphen-ated framework, every clue is either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*.
  - A *Play Clue* is a promise that a card can be played.
  - A *Save Clue* prevents a card from being discarded. It can only be used on *Chop* cards.
- When multiple cards are touched by a clue, only one card is the *Focus* of the clue.
  - We'll explain later how to determine the *Focus* of a clue.
  - Nothing is promised about the other cards beyond that they will be useful at some point (called the *Good Touch Principle*).
- We also agree as a team to save all important cards (*Save Principle*).
- We also agree as a team to get at least one new card with every clue (*Minimum Clue Value Principle*).
