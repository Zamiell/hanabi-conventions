## Conventions & Special Moves

### 2 Saves (Intermediate Section)

- As explained in the [beginner's guide](beginner.md), *2 Saves* must be given with a number 2 clue.
  - The exception to this rule is when the other copy of the 2 is in the discard pile. Then you can do a "normal" *Save Clue* on the 2 with a color clue.
- Players are **not allowed** to perform a *2 Save* on a 2 if the other copy of the 2 is visible in someone else's hand.
  - The exception to this rule is when the same 2 is on two people's chops at the same time. In that situation, players are allowed to *2 Save* whichever one they want. And if it is the *Early Game*, then players **must** choose to save one of them before initiating the *Mid-Game*.

### The Early Game (Intermediate Section)

- The *Early Game* is introduced in the [beginner's guide](beginner.md). In short:
  - The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before the first discard happens.
  - Players **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* on the board before ending the *Early Game*.
- As an intermediate player, you need to know about a few extra rules about the *Early Game*. We don't bother telling the extra rules to beginners because they deal with some edge-case situations. We have the extra rules in place because we want to "squeeze" as much value out of the conventions as possible.

#### Ending the Early Game

- The *Early Game* is only ended when the first **completely unknown** card is discarded.
- In other words:
  - Misplaying a card **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.
  - Discarding known trash **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.
  - Doing special discards that "transfer" cards to other players **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.

#### Extinguishing Every Clue

- Extinguishing every clue **does** include *5 Stalling*, but it is only mandatory for the team to collectively perform one *5 Stall*. If one *5 Stall* clue has already been given and there is another *5 Stall* clue available, players are allowed to clue it if they want, but they don't have to.
- Extinguishing every clue **does not** include giving *Tempo Clues* (e.g. clues that do not meet *Minimum Clue Value Principle*).
- Extinguishing every clue **does not** include cluing something in the hand of the player who came directly before. This is because the player who came before did not see anything for the next player to do, and is therefore giving them "permission" to discard. In this situation, cluing is optional; players can choose to either clue the previous hand or discard at their discretion.
- Extinguishing every clue **does not** include cluing cards that will be almost certainly be *Order Chop Moved* by an upcoming player who already has two or more 1's clued in their hand.

### 5 Stalls (Intermediate Section)

- As mentioned in the [beginner's guide](beginner.md), *5 Stalls* are when a player clues an off-chop 5 purely because they want (or need) to give a stall clue.
- *5 Stalls* are usually performed in the *Early Game*. Less commonly, they can also be performed in the *Mid-Game* if a player happens to be in a special "stalling" situation where they are not allowed to discard.
- In the *Early Game*, the team can give as many *5 Stalls* as they want before initiating the *Mid-Game*.
- Regardless of whether they are done in the *Early Game* or the *Mid-Game*, *5 Stalls* are only allowed if there is nothing else "normal" to do (like playing a card, giving a normal *Play Clue*, or giving a normal *Save Clue*).
  - However, as an exception, players are also allowed to *5 Stall* if there is **only one** *Play Clue* remaining and it would touch a card that someone else on the team could conceivably *Finesse*. (We refer to this as the *Finesse Position Exception*, or FPE.)
  - The *Finesse Position Exception* also applies if the same card is in multiple *Finesse Positions* and there is nothing else to do.
  - The *Finesse Position Exception* applies whenever a player performs a *5 Stall*, regardless of whether it is in the *Early Game* or not.
- *5 Stalls* **cannot** be given in the *Mid-Game* if there are any playable 5's. In this situation, a number 5 clue would just look like a *Play Clue* on the 5.
- *5 Stalls* **must** be given to the 5 that is closest to chop. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the *Early Game*. The only thing left for Alice to do is to clue an off-chop 5.
  - Bob has two playable 1's on slots 1 and 2. He has a 5 on slot 4. Bob's 5 is therefore one-away from chop.
  - Cathy has nothing clued in her hand. She has a 5 on slot 3. Cathy's 5 is therefore two-away from chop.
  - Alice must clue number 5 to Bob as a *5 Stall* since his 5 is closer to chop (even though Bob has two playable cards).
- Some additional rules for *5 Stalls* are found in the section on [the *Early Game*](#the-early-game-intermediate-section).

### Allowable Stall Clues (Stall Table)

- In certain special situations, everyone understands that a player might be giving a "stall" clue. However, there are limits - they are not allowed to just clue anything they want. These are the specific clues that they are allowed to give along with the precedence of each clue:

| Precedence | Type of Clue | Early Game (Severity 1) | Double Discard / Scream Discard (Severity 2) | Locked Hand (Severity 3) | 8 Clues (Severity 4)
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------
| 1          | Normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues*                                                    | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 2          | *5 Stall* (cluing off-chop 5's)                                                        | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 3          | *Tempo Clue* (re-cluing a card to make it play)                                        | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | *Locked Hand Save* (saving any card on chop, as long as doing so would not *Lock* the other player) | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | *8 Clue Save* (saving any card not on slot 1) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | Filling in extra info on clued cards or *Chop Moved* cards                             | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 5          | *Hard Burn* (re-cluing an unplayable card that gives no new information, usually a 5)  | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔

- For example:
  - It is a *Double Discard* situation (severity 2).
  - Alice does not have the option to perform any normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* (precedence 1).
  - Alice does have the option to perform a *5 Stall* (precedence 2).
  - Thus, Alice is not allowed to perform a *Tempo Clue* (precedence 3), or anything below that.
- For example:
  - It is a *Double Discard* situation (severity 2).
  - Alice does not have the option to perform any normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* (precedence 1), and Alice does not have the option to *5 Stall* (precedence 2).
  - Alice does have the option to perform a *Tempo Clue* (precedence 3).
  - Thus, Alice is not allowed to give a *Fill-In Clue* (precedence 4) or a *Hard Burn* (precedence 5).
- What is the point of having a complicated table with defined priorities? Well, normally, players in stalling situations are not able to give tricky-looking *Finesses*, because everyone else on the team will think that they are giving a stall clue. However, if it can be seen that there is a better clue available for them to give, then everyone can know that they are **not** giving a stall clue. Thus, because of this precedence table, players in stalling situations are still often able to make *Finesses* happen.
- Obviously, stall clues are not allowed when the player has a known playable card in their hand.

### Locked Hands (Severity 3 Stalling)

- Generally speaking, it is a bad situation when someone's hand gets fully clued. This is also known as being *Locked*, and it should be avoided if possible. However, sometimes it cannot be helped, like when a player draws three 5's in a row.
- A player with a *Locked Hand* may give a low-value clue because they are not sure that they can play anything (and they can't discard because their hand is fully clued). Similar to a *Double Discard* situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.
- If the team is out of clues and someone's hand is fully clued, then you **have** to discard to generate a clue for them. Similarly, if there is only 1 clue left, you cannot steal it from them.

### The Locked Hand Save (LHS)

- We agree that players with a *Locked Hand* gain the special ability to save any card they want on chop (as long as it would not *Lock* the other player). This is called a *Locked Hand Save*.
- A *Locked Hand Save* can be performed on **any** card, not just a critical or playable card.
- However, players can only do a *Locked Hand Save* if there are no higher precedence clues available. See the "Allowable Stall Clues" section above.
- A *Locked Hand Save* can be performed with either a color clue or a number clue.
- If a clue that looks like a *Locked Hand Save* would *Lock* another player, it is instead treated as a normal *Play Clue* or a normal *Save Clue*.
- Note that the precedence of a *Locked Hand Save* is tied with a "fill-in" clue. Essentially, this means that players who have a *Locked Hand* are not forced to perform a *Locked Hand Save* if they do not want to. Most of the time, doing a *Locked Hand Save* will be pretty good (as a 1-for-1 or a 2-for-1 instead of a 0-for-1), but *Locked* players can always ignore a *Locked Hand Save* to perform a "fill-in" clue if they want.

### The Anxiety Play (Forcing a Locked Player to Play)

- Sometimes, someone with a *Locked Hand* has a playable card, but they do not know that they can play it yet. Re-cluing the card would signal this, but that would waste a clue and not be very efficient.
- A better way to signal this information is to deliberately leave them at 0 clues. By convention, this means that one of their cards is actually playable. The player should play the card in their hand that is most likely to be playable. If there is more than one option, then they should know that the left-most is playable. (This follows from *Left-Most Playable Principle*.)
- This is called an *Anxiety Play* because you are putting the *Locked* player in a "do or die" situation.

### Clues Given While at 8 Clues (Severity 4 Stalling)

- At the beginning of the game, you start with 8 clues. This section only applies to situations where you climb to 8 clues in the middle of the game.
- First, see the section on [Locked Hands](#locked-hands-severity-3-stalling).
- A player who has a turn with 8 clue tokens available may give a low-value clue because they cannot play anything (and they cannot discard because the game does not allow you to discard while at 8 clues). Similar to a *Double Discard* or a *Locked Hand* situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.

### The 8 Clue Save

- At the beginning of the game, you start with 8 clues. This section only applies to situations where you climb to 8 clues in the middle of the game.
- We agree that players who have 8 clues available on their turn gain the special ability to save any card they want on **or** off chop (as long as it is not on slot 1). This is called an *8 Clue Save*.
- An *8 Clue Save* can be performed on **any** card, not just a critical or playable card.
- However, players can only do an *8 Clue Save* if there are no higher precedence clues available. See the "Allowable Stall Clues" section above.
- An *8 Clue Save* can be performed with either a color clue or a number clue.
- If a clue that looks like an *8 Clue Save* is on a card that is on slot 1, it is instead treated as a normal *Play Clue* or a normal *Save Clue*.

### The Distribution Clue

- In the *End-Game*, when a player has many playable cards, there is the risk that they will not be able to play all cards before the end of the game.
- Thus, it might make sense to spend a clue to duplicate one of their playable cards in someone else's hand. This would violate *Good Touch Principle*, but it would relieve the player with the loaded hand from some of the card-playing burden.
- Since it distributes plays more evenly throughout the team, this is called a *Distribution Clue*. *Distribution Clues* better satisfy *Team Distribution Principle*.

<br />

## General Principles

### Misplay Cost Principle

- On a turn where a player misplays and accumulates a strike for the team, they could have discarded instead and generated a clue.
- So, if you can spend one clue to stop one misplay, the value comes out even.
- Thus, since there are only 2 strikes allowed and accumulating strikes limits flexibility, it is almost always worth it to spend one clue to stop one strike.
- If it would require two clues to stop an impending misplay, then as long as the strike would not lose the game, it is usually best to let the player misplay the card and get a strike.

### Team Distribution Principle

- In general, it is better for useful cards to be distributed **evenly** throughout the team. This is especially important in 5-player games.
- Thus, if one of your teammates has 3 out of 4 cards clued, it may be better for **them** to be the one giving the clues, and you to be the one discarding - even if their chop is known trash.
- There are multiple reasons for this. First, you don't want them to get a *Locked Hand*, which is generally bad. Second, if they continue to draw playable cards, the game may end before they get a chance to play them all.

### End-Game Threshold (End Game)

- Towards the end of the game, the strategy of the team will change. In most games, you stop becoming concerned with efficiency and become more concerned with tempo - every card needs to play **right now** before the game ends!
- Thus, since clues can mean different things depending on whether you are in the *Mid-Game* or the *End-Game*, you need to be able to keep track of when the *End-Game* has arrived.
- *Pace* is used to determine *End-Game* status. If pace is **less than the number of players**, the *End-Game* has arrived.
  - On [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live), pace will turn yellow when this occurs.
- If pace is **less than the number of players / 2**, you should be very careful with discarding. It might still be the best thing to do, but if there are enough clues in the bank, it is usually better to *Burn* a clue (meaning to deliberately waste a clue).
- If pace is 0, no more discards can happen in order to get the maximum score.
- If pace is below 0, it is impossible to get the maximum score.

### The Pace +1 Rule

- Players can use *Pace* to determine if it is safe to discard. In general, a group can discard down to pace 0 and still get a perfect score.
- However, as a rule, if pace is +1 and one of the players on your team **does not** have any playable cards, then you cannot discard - **you must let them perform the final discard**.
- If both you and another player do not have any playable cards, then you can do the final discard - the team won't be able to get a perfect score anyway. But if you **could** have an unknown playable card in your hand, then you should be very careful about discarding, because it could ruin a perfect score.

### Burning (End-Game Stalling)

- In the *End-Game*, often times there are still a lot of cards yet to be played. Thus, you need to be very careful when discarding, since by drawing a card you can make the game end before everyone has a chance to play all of the cards.
- If there are enough of clues available, you can choose to stall, by giving a low-value (or even a completely useless) clue. This is referred to as *Burning* a clue.
- The best way to give a useless clue is to re-clue cards which are already known to be playable.
- Give a *Burn Clue* if:
  - There is a possibility that the game can be completed without anyone discarding from now on.
  - You have two or more useful cards in your hand, and you want to follow *Team Distribution Principle*.
- Do not give a *Burn Clue* if:
  - The end-game has not started yet (see the *End-Game Threshold*).
  - You know that someone else will have to discard in the future.

### End-Game Strategy

- The previous three sections introduce the *End-Game* at a high-level. When the *End-Game* arrives, you should probably be changing the way you play.
- However, giving specific advice for the *End-Game* is very difficult - things vary widely based on the deal and there are a lot of different things to consider.
- The best advice is to play lots of games of Hanabi to get a feel for the most common situations. But there is no substitute for thinking through each *End-Game* yourself, one step at a time. Ask questions like:
  - Which cards are left in the deck that we need?
  - What is the probability of drawing those cards?
  - Who should be drawing those cards?
  - Does stalling produce a line that is better than playing?
- If you really want to get into the weeds of *End-Game* strategy, Romain has written a [short strategy guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jKFqt9WbWAc1Dj3M2E_kwDwS3J0xeIp0UNkiqkLLApk/edit) that goes into more depth.
