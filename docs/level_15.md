title: Level 15 - Erudite
---

- Level 15 strategies should only be learned if you have 260+ games of experience with the group.
- This level introduces *Discharges*.

### Discharge

- *Discharge* is similar to *Ejection*, except instead of blind-playing the *Second Finesse Position* card, the player plays the *Third Finesse Position* card.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.
- Several different kinds of moves can cause a *Discharge*. The most common one is called the *Unknown Trash Discharge*.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge (1-for-1 Form) (UTD)

- In general, *Bluffs* work because the blind-play tells the person who was clued that they have a *one-away-from-playable* card of that color.
- In general, *Trash Bluffs* work because the blind-play tells the person who was clued that they have a trash card.
- Players must be careful to not give a *Trash Bluff* that looks like a *Bluff* - that will desynchronize the team.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as blue 2.
  - Cathy knows that a *Bluff* has occurred and marks her red card as red 3 (the *one-away-from-playable* red card).
  - Of course, this is not true, because Cathy's red card is actually a red 1. The team will likely get a misplay at some point in the future.
- If the above example happens and Alice is not making a mistake, then Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. This should signal an *Discharge* on the very next player.
- Since the *Third Finesse Position* card was played instead of the *Finesse Position* card, then the player who received the clue will know that the card is trash.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that if he played his *First Finesse Position*, then Cathy would write a note of red 3 on the card (as a *Bluff*), which would be a *Lie*.
  - Bob knows that if he played his *Second Finesse Position*, then Cathy would write a note of red 5 on the card (as a *5 Color Ejection*), which would be a *Lie*.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Third Finesse Position*. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that a *Discharge* has occurred from Alice's red clue. This must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, so the focus of the clue must be trash.
  - Cathy marks her red card as a red 1 (since that is the only possible trash red card) and discards it.
- In summary:
  - For a *Trash Bluff*:
    - The empathy on the clued card **only** contains possibilities that are *Playable*, *Delayed Playable*, or trash.
    - Thus, a normal blind-play is enough to prove it is trash.
  - For an *Unknown Trash Discharge*:
    - The empathy on the clued card contains one or more possibilities that are useful and currently unplayable.
    - Thus, something extra is needed to prove it is trash.
  - Other than this, don't use more complicated factors to prefer a *Trash Bluff* over an *Unknown Trash Discharge* (like Bob having to wait on some other card).

### The Unknown Trash Discharge (2-for-1 Form) (UTD)

- When multiple cards are clued with an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, **only the focus of the clue is considered to be trash**. This means that *Good Touch Principle* applies to the non-focused cards.
- Note that this is **the opposite of the *Trash Bluff***. (In a *Trash Bluff*, when multiple cards are clued, all of the touched cards are considered to be trash.)
- This means that while most *Unknown Trash Discharges* are 1-for-1 clues, you can also perform an *Unknown Trash Discharge* as a 2-for-1, a 3-for-1, and so forth.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - (This is almost exactly the same as the previous example.)
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 on slot 2 and a red 5 on slot 3. The red 1 is focused. This looks like a *Play Clue* on the red 1.
  - Bob knows that this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, so he blind-plays his *Third Finesse Position*. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that a *Discharge* has occurred from Alice's red clue. This must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, so the focus of the clue must be trash.
  - Cathy marks her slot 2 card as a red 1 (since that is the only possible trash red card) and discards it.
  - Cathy also knows that non-focused cards touched in an *Unknown Trash Discharge* are supposed to be useful. Thus, Cathy marks her slot 3 card as a red 2, a red 3, a red 4, or a red 5.

### 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

- This convention only applies in the *Low Score Phase*.
- Players are only allowed to perform a *5 Stall* in certain situations. If a player performs a *5 Stall* when it would otherwise be illegal, then it is not a *5 Stall* at all, and would instead be:
  - a *5's Chop Move* if the 5 is one-away-from-chop
  - a *5 Pull* if the 5 is two-or-more-away-from-chop and the card to the right of it is playable
  - a *5 Pull Finesse* if the 5 is two-or-more-away-from-chop and the card to the right of it is *one-away-from-playable*
- However, what if the 5 is two-or-more-away-from-chop and the card to the right of it is *two-or-more-away-from-playable* **or** trash? This would be quite strange.
- We agree that this signals a *Discharge* and that the next player should play their *Third Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  - Cathy hand is, from newest to oldest: red 5, red 3, green 2, green 1, green 2
  - Bob thinks about what Alice's 5 clue could mean:
    - The clue cannot be a *5 Stall*, because there is a green 1 to *Play Clue*.
    - The clue cannot be a *5 Pull*, because the red 3 is not playable.
    - The clue cannot be a *5 Pull Finesse*, because the red 3 is *two-away-from-playable*.
  - Since Bob would have to blind-play two cards into the *Finesse* (the same rule as in *5 Color Ejections*), Bob knows that he should instead treat this as a *5 Number Discharge*. Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the red 1.
- After a *5 Number Discharge*, the card next to the 5 should be marked accordingly. For example, if a *5 Number Discharge* happens on the first turn of the game, then the team should mark the "pulled" card as a 3 or a 4.
- More examples of a *5 Number Discharge* can be found [here](examples/5_number_discharge.md).

### 5 Number Discharge Finesse Position Skips

- First, see the section on the *[5 Number Discharge](#5-number-discharge-5nd)*.
- After a *5 Number Discharge* occurs, it is common for the card next to the 5 to be marked as a 3 or a 4.
- If the 5 was on slot 1, then the marked card is now on *Finesse Position*. For most intents and purposes, this "marking" from a *5 Number Discharge* **does not** change the player's *Finesse Position* - their *Finesse Position* is still the card marked as a 3 or a 4.
- However, if that player is *Finessed* for a 1 or a 2, then it is fairly obvious that they should not play the card that is marked as a 3 or a 4. In this case, the player should skip over their *Finesse Position* card and instead play their *Second Finesse Position*.
