## Miscellaneous

<br />

### The Early Game

- We define the *Early Game* as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
- The general goal of the *Early Game* is to extend it for as long as reasonably possible. Thus, everyone agrees that they **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before discarding. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but *Save Clues* still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)
- In the *Early Game*, you can do a special move called a *5 Stall*; see below.

<br />

### The 5 Stall (Cluing Off Chop 5's)

- Normally, you are only allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a 5 if it is on chop. So if you use number 5 to clue a 5 that is **not** on chop, then it will typically look like a *Play Clue* on that 5 (or some other advanced strategy).
- As a special rule, in the *Early Game*, you **are** allowed to clue number 5 as a *Save Clue* to off chop 5's. Doing this is just interpreted as a "stall" clue and that you are trying to extend the *Early Game* for a little bit longer.
- However, you are **only** allowed to do this if there is nothing else to do, meaning that all of the "normal" *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* have been extinguished.
- Normally, *5 Stalls* are only performed in the *Early Game*. However, you might see someone do a *5 Stall* in the *Mid-Game* if they are in a special situation where they are not allowed to discard.

<br />

### Other General Strategy

- In general, the first thing you should do on your turn is to **look at the chop cards of everyone on the team**. Are there any cards on chop that need to be saved (or *Play Clued*)? If so, do you have to do it, or can someone else do it?
  - If no-one else can do it, then you need to give the *Save Clue* (or *Play Clue*), even if you have a card to play.
  - If someone else can do it, would it be better for you to save the card, or for them? If they have a card to play and you do not have a card to play, then it is better teamwork for you to save the card.
- In general, ***Play Clues* should be given over *Save Clues***. There's no need to give a *Save Clue* to someone if you can preoccupy them with playing a card!
- In general, if you have a choice, **color clues should be given over number clues**. Color clues are usually more specific, telling the player the exact identity of the card. (But of course, don't be afraid to use number clues if it helps to "fill in" other cards in the hand.)
- In general, **don't be afraid of discarding**. If you discard something important, it won't be your fault - it is your teammates' responsibility to save any important cards.

<br />

## Special Moves

- Hanabi is a game of trying to be as efficient as possible, since there is a limited number of clues.
- Thus, it is ideal to get **two** or more cards to play from **one** clue.
- Players can use two special "moves" to do this: *Prompts* and *Finesses*.

<br />

### The Prompt

- In the example below:
  - Bob has a clued red card in his hand, but the full identity of the card is still unknown to him. In this situation, he knows he is supposed to just keep the card in his hand and continue to discard unclued cards.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches a red 4. This must be a *Play Clue* on the red 4.
  - Bob sees that red 4 is currently unplayable, since the red 3 is not played yet. Thus, this clue implies that someone has the red 3.
  - Bob does not see a red 3 clued in anyone else's hand. So, Alice must be promising him that his unknown red card is red 3 and that he can safely play it.

<Prompt1 />

- We call this move a *Prompt* because it is "prompting" a player to play a card that they would have otherwise held on to for a while longer.
- In this way, clues can deliver messages to a different player than the person who actually received the clue.
- If a player is *Prompted* and there are multiple cards in the hand that the *Prompt* could apply to, they should play the left-most.
- In the example below:
  - Bob is *Prompted* for a red 3 in the exact same way as the previous example.
  - Bob has two different cards clued as red in slot 4 and slot 5.
  - Since both cards are unknown to Bob, Bob should choose to play the slot 4 card since it is the left-most.

<Prompt2 />

- In the example below:
  - Bob has an unknown 3 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches a 4. It must be a *Play Clue* on the 4.
  - There is no 4 that could possibly be playable right now. Thus, this must be a *Self-Prompt*, meaning that Bob's 3 must be either blue 3 or green 3.
  - Bob plays his 3, and it is blue 3. Thus, he knows that the 4 must connect and be a blue 4.

<Prompt3 />

- The *Prompt* is a **promise** that the player has the connecting card. Therefore, if the left-most card is not the correct one, the player should continue to play his clued cards (left to right) until the expected card is found. (It is the responsibility of the player giving the clue to ensure that all those previous cards will play successfully.)
- In the example below:
  - Bob has three separate unknown 3's in his hand.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches a red 4. This is a *Play Clue* on the red 4.
  - Bob knows that he must have the red 3 and this is a *Prompt*. Bob plays his left-most 3 from slot 2.
  - However, after playing it, Bob sees that it is not the red 3 - it was the blue 3 (which played successfully). Bob now knows that the next-left-most 3 must be the red 3 (on slot 3).
  - Cathy can see the clued red 3 in Bob's hand. Thus, she knows from the *Good Touch Principle* that her red card must be the red 4.
  - Cathy does something unrelated.
  - On his next turn, Bob tries to play his slot 3 card as the red 3. However, after playing it, Bob sees that it was not the red 3 - it was the green 3 (which played successfully). Bob now knows that his final 3 must be the red 3 (on slot 4).
  - On his next turn, Bob plays his slot 4 card, and it is red 3.
  - Cathy can now finally play her red 4.

### The Finesse

- Normally, players will only play cards that have been clued by someone else on the team.
- However, it is also possible to tell a player to blind-play a card without any clues on it at all.
- In the example below:
  - Bob has no clued cards in his hand.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 4. This must be a *Play Clue* on the red 4.
  - Bob sees that the red 4 is currently unplayable. Assuming Alice is not making a mistake, this clue implies that someone has the red 3.
  - Bob does not see a red 3 clued in anyone else's hand. So, Alice must be promising him that he has a red 3.
  - Normally, Bob knows that this would be a *Prompt*. But Bob does not have any red cards and Bob does not have any 3's. So where is the red 3?
  - Bob knows that this must be a *Finesse* - he is promised that his left-most unclued card is the red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 3.
  - Cathy sees the blind-play happen immediately after this red clue, so she knows that she must have the connecting red card, the red 4.
  - Cathy plays the red 4.

<Finesse1 />

- Note that ***Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses***. Players should never blind-play a card if the situation can apply to the clued cards in their hand.
- When a *Finesse* occurs, it causes temporary information desynchronization. (In the previous example, if Bob did nothing, Cathy would go on to think that she had the red 3, but she really doesn't have the red 3, which means that information is not synchronized throughout the team.)
- For this reason, blind-playing a card into a *Finesse* is very important - by doing so, it resynchronizes all of the information. So, **if a player is *Finessed*, they should usually blind-play the card immediately**, even if they have other important cards to play or some good clue to give.
- We define the *Finesse Position* as the slot that a player's left-most unclued card is in. A player's *Finesse Position* can move around, and if it does, it is still possible to *Finesse* them.
- In the example below:
  - Alice clues Cathy red, which touches two red cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Cathy assumes that the slot 1 card is a red 1.
  - Next, Bob clues Donald blue, which touches a blue 2.
  - Now, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy knows that she must have the blue 1 and that Bob is trying to perform a *Finesse*.
  - Blind-playing the blue 1 is more important than playing the red 1.
  - Normally, Cathy's *Finesse Position* would be her left-most card. However, since Cathy's slot 1 and slot 2 card are already clued, her *Finesse Position* card has shifted down to her slot 3. Thus, Cathy must blind-play the blue 1 from slot 3.
