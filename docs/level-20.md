## Conventions

<br />

### Ignition

- An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
- An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  - unrelated to the clue that was given
    - e.g. It does not "connect", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  - unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    - e.g. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.

<br />

## Double Ignition

- Several types of "useless" clues trigger a *Double Ignition*. These different types are listed below.
- When a *Double Ignition* is triggered, it means that two players on the team need to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as any playable card.
  - *Double Ignition* does not necessarily have to be on the next two players. It can be on anyone.
- In most circumstances, a *Double Ignition* should be clear. This is because the two players that have a playable card will each see that the clue giver should have clued the other playable card directly (instead of giving a "useless" clue).
- Sometimes, three players on the team will have playable cards on *Finesse Position*. If a *Double Ignition* is performed in this case, similar to how an *Ambiguous Finesse* works, it will "get" the two cards from the final two players. (Bob will do nothing because he sees that the *Double Ignition* is on Cathy and Donald.)

<br />

### The Trash Double Ignition

- Towards the end of the game, if a player clues one or more brand-new trash cards, and the cards are known to be trash, then there are usually 2 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known trash in another player's hand (off-chop).
- However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known trash in another player's hand (on-chop).
- However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### Otherwise, a Trash Double Ignition

- If the known trash clue cannot be either of these two things, then it communicates a *Trash Double Ignition*.
- Players should always assume a *Trash Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*, since the latter is very rare. (*Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* is an advanced move that is covered later on.)
- Also, see the section on [Trash Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-trash-ejection).

<br />

### The Replay Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known playable card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard. (This is most common in [the *End-Game*](level-7.md#burning-end-game-stalling).
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Replay Double Ignition* because you are re-giving a *Play Clue*.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Replay Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-replay-ejection).

<br />

### The Poke Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known trash card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard.
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Poke Double Ignition* because by re-touching a trash card, it is like you are poking the player.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Poke Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-poke-ejection).

<br />

## The Playful Ignition

- If a directly playable card is on chop, it's generally very strange to *Chop Move* it if it could just be given a direct *Chop-Focus Play Clue*. This is because doing so can be extremely bad for tempo and can cause issues with *Clue Focus* in the future.
- However, what if a player performs a *Chop Move* on a playable card while there seems to be no good reason to do so? They must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they are really trying to perform a *Playful Ignition*, which *Ignites* a card from the next player. The next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, which gives the player with the *Chop Moved* card enough information to know that it is actually playable.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  - It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that since there were other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, Cathy will interpret this as an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  - Bob also knows that it is nonsensical to *Chop Move* a playable red 1 - Alice could have just give a red *Chop-Focus Play Clue* to the red 1.
  - Thus, this must be a *Playful Ignition*, so Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Playful Ignition*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

- Sometimes, it can be useful to *Chop Move* a playable card. Something is only a *Playful Ignition* if there is not some other good reason for the *Chop Move*. Specifically, the player might want to:
  - Avoid violating *Good Touch Principle*.
  - Save a *Delayed Playable* card that is followed by a critical card.
  - Save two important cards when there are a lot of cards to deal with and the team is low on clues.
  - Get a blind-play from *Elimination* when the duplicate is visible.
- More examples of a *Playful Ignition* can be found [here](../examples/5-double-pull.md).

<br />

### Interaction with 5 Rank Clues

- This interaction is turned **off** in the *End-Game*.
- When playing with both *Bad Chop Move Ejections* and *Playful Ignitions*, **every** rank clue that newly touches a 5 that is one away from chop should be considered a *Chop Move*.
- In other words, a *5's Chop Move* interpretation **always** takes precedence over a *Direct Play Clue* on the focused 5.
- Therefore, players must remember that regardless of any resulting blind-play, the focused 5 could still be any color. Instead, such a blind-play **always** relates to the card being *Chop Moved* by the clue, not the 5 directly.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is no longer *Early Game*, and blue 3 and green 2 are on the stack.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: green 2, yellow 3, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues 5 to Cathy, touching a green 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob sees this is a *Playful Ignition*, and therefore blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 4 and it successfully plays.
  - It is now Cathy's turn. Even though a blue 4 was just blind-played, Cathy knows that this does not indicate that her 5 is necessarily blue; it could still be any color. Since Alice's clue was by definition a *5's Chop Move*, Cathy knows that this must mean Bob was reacting to the *Chop Move*.
  - Cathy understands that Bob must have blind-played as a *Playful Ignition*. She blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

- Inversely, even if a directly playable 5 is given a rank clue while one away from chop, the next player may still be expected to respond as a *Bad Chop Move Ejection* or *Playful Ignition* if the resulting *Chop Move* would be abnormal.
